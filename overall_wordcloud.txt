has been red for almost year showed the nation that made our voices heard threes disappointed the president would vote shrink our electricity grid and underfund this vital part our lives but move this weakens the 64tn investment into our energy future about senmaximusemperio replying threes the president did not shrink our energy grid any way form claim otherwise nothing short delusion the provisions the awful bill you authored that the emperio act repeals never did anything your investment was mere ten lines new statute contained within largely unenforceable bill whose only solution the energy crisis was throwing 320 billion and hoping the crisis would fix itself senmaximusemperio your amateurish bill mandated the construction mind boggling 146 000 miles new transmission capacity which number that probably sounded good paper the idiots that helped you draft and the voters you deceived with but wholly unattainable realistically here are the facts that construction target roughly equates 440 000 miles new lines constructed mind boggling 176 increase current grid capacity grid that mind you was built over century but here the kicker the current rate construction 700 miles year this would take leisurely 260 years build senmaximusemperio that actually best case scenario estimate you actually understood what actually happening the ground you know that currently facing crippling shortage electrical steel essential building the insane amount capacity your awful bill proposed you also know that have severe shortage large power transformers and damning lack skilled linemen actually build what did your bill fix these the very least admit their existence nothing the rate construction would have remained unchanged with your bill carolmarks glad have senator emperio representing the senate threes the only thing you spew hatred you want textwall textwall against think you find you already lost let look the costs your bill 300gw funded billion dollars let estimate that around 000 miles raw construction that 549 450 dollars per mile please tell what ingenious technology you invented somehow cut costs fold let reasonable here your bill underfunded and tried help you put forward amendment which would provide adequate funding but got shot down and what doing isn throwing 320 billion dollars problem providing investments billion year which less than few weeks spending our military instead defending your bill you instead choose attack the writing bill apologise for being too ignorant not provide map where these transmission lines would built wait actually tried solve the problem and your solution make other people find solution for you because unlike you actually willing the work you call the people who work for idiots which great affront very fine advisors who the work for the people like question your advisors less insulting terms who told you could construct 000 miles transmission lines for half million per mile you mention rate construction but please tell how many projects were ongoing beforehand august 2022 and how much capacity you couldn because you weren even there don even know what happened you died something went missing and magically came back like you were revived from the dead you claim rates would stay the same but you fail realise simple thing you create the jobs people will fill them you create project work towards people will work towards years might bit ambitious goal and were back probably use longer timeframe but the fact are transition renewable energy need the capacity let use your rate 700 miles year completely metric that doesn take into account the demand for construction your proposal would take years build then new york city sees land underwater new orleans continues erode away miami somewhat underwater see what happens when you don take into account your own metrics and apply them your own bill you get things like that let talk about aluminum you know how much the extracts from scrap metal alone the millions 100 000 tons aluminum would long way lengthening our energy grid capacity you continue laughably saying that bill did nothing try and solve training shortage steel neither does yours this laughable hypocrisy you had been around back july and august you have seen the research and the talks held this was not one person writing bill this was numerous politicians and numerous policy expects consulted behind the scenes the crafting bill never claimed expert energy policy understand you have election coming and seeing the tides the recent frontier senate race you feel pressure your job security don pretend something not consistently authentic the american people your final sentence freaking hilarious respect for the private industry that built this country wasn the private industry that built this country was the workers and the people who built this country private industry benefitted off the backs the working class this country and spit the face them insinuate their exploitative overlords and corporate bosses built this country over rank and file people course don think you know that since the modern gop loves protect corporate interests fuck the 280 character limit amirite troll threes oops seemed like hit the character limit would have more say but prefer debate person rather than grandstand twitter also rather keep policy rather than hominem but would have supported your bill was purely improving regulations because those are good parts only opposition was the shrinking the grid expansion which agree years may have been too ambitious and the gross underfunding the program which tried rectify anyways any news organisation wishes host debate between myself and the senator open senmaximusemperio replying threes please tell what ingenious technology you invented somehow cut costs fold sure called the miracle private enterprise look genuinely baffled you somehow deluded yourself into believing the federal government has paid out pocket full for the 240 000 miles high voltage lines tsos across the country currently maintain individual electric utilities are more than capable recuperating their costs after the fact operating the very facilities they build senmaximusemperio and what doing isn throwing 320 billion dollars problem providing investments 320 billion investment weird way spell stole 1200 out every working american pocket ill conceived notion big government paying for everything without even doing the due diligence bothering legislate any guidance how use that money the end the day still ten lines provisions for 320 billion dollar investment threes you not getting out this hurling buzzwords senmaximusemperio actually willing the work ten lines that what your work was you drew lines map stop embarrassing yourself senmaximusemperio you couldn because you weren even there don even know what happened you died something went missing and magically came back like you were revived from the dead what are you even saying you not inebriated are you anyway the rate construction and whatever demand for construction this isn high school economics demand isn straight line the industrial apparatus almost triple existing transmission capacity does not exist period vpaxel senator emperio laid down the facts arena the socialists are ill equipped enter edited ambassadoranka shall declare

their cost per mile trans bay million per mile eastern alberta million per mile eia study between million and million per mile the emperio act 549 450 per mile hate quote ronald reagan but there you again using facts and prior projects whereas you simply use feelings and insults try and gain reddit karma and twitter likes ask you like annoying college professor please cite your sources let address your next issue saying stole 1200 out every working american pocket you are aware how much more spend the military right you want direct your hatred government spending that surely place and hey billion divided the working population gives you 370 dollars that was how economics worked great but this not the 4th century when landlords would take grain from their peasants although landlords today are still insanely predatory but that another issue and team crafted map determine where these projects would identified what areas required the alloy that generally used american transmission lines which you railed about your speech defending your bill let introduce you something you probably didn learn economics modern monetary theory you see here the united states control our fiat currency the dollar the strongest global currency control the supply our money this nation spend money say million going towards new road some keystrokes happen that give the relevant agencies million dollars and that money gets spent building new road then time take taxes after spending inflationary control the economy when the resources are available which they are there very little any inflationary impact friend warren hersey would know lot more about this believe studied extensively but gone unfortunately hey point made this not stealing money from anyone frame government spending that wholly disingenuous you say should stop using buzzwords perhaps you should stop making false statements what were the words the voters you deceived with let keep going here kinda enjoying this haven had this sort fierce debate year shoutout our vice president fmr senator drawing lines map decide where projects said earlier there has been analysis where projects are needed and they are needed places such texas the midwest the eastern seaboard anywhere where humans live they need energy have identify where capacity going and where capacity needs come from sustainable future you need solar energy from arizona and texas north wind energy from home state illinois east hydropower from the eastern seaboard south and nuclear power our deep south west you need consider all those factors which were considered apologise for not inviting you into the room the time but unfortunately got lost the mail https discord com channels 654458344781774879 781935772605218817 871742113405100062 you unfortunately died while back but came back sure the american people are fascinated know where you came from and where you went during that time you weren dead once again you throw insults because you

your link doesn work weirdly enough threes the year the ten million cuba sugar production was maybe around million the year before and increased million massive increase you try something can happen unlike yourself perhaps believe the power humanity get things done throughout human existence done that consistently the space race for instance unsure the exact figures miles that had been constructed the past months but estimate uptick doubt that very fact place bet against the ability our nation adapt and overcome which bet people lose time and time again let move you know what the proportion aluminium 1350 h19 alloy the metal gets strain hardened high pressures process that can done industrially the way the answer units tons since nitpicking think you need someone who knows what they are doing run your twitter account you state this doe study but can actually produce have scoured databases and can find now admit not infallible unlike yourself this may mistake but cannot find this did this come from the same place you got the cost estimate 549 450 dollars per mile did come from the realms jupiter neptune from hogwarts read the bill why you think spoke fervently about the house floor why speaking about now let say years again according your own metrics delayed decade years that 2072 friend and can say bye the maldives then you once again only apply your metrics things you dislike without being critical your own work mine would take that many years yours under the same metrics would take many years too now could have done some minor tomfoolery with section amending and only having the requirement for renewable energy but that take efforts one repeal your bill and one amend bill automatic approval your own admission decreases planning times haven even touched eminent domain awful practice which you utilise your bill the youngsters say smh let keep going again you mention disdain that mentioned the alloy which used american transmission wires general bit weird but you then make ridiculously false claims don even think you yourself believe since don pretend make out that intellectually superior anyone maybe you projecting your insecurities don know maybe psychiatrist counsellor could help you with that after all they are the experts sometimes better concise than overstay your welcome and believe you have overstayed your welcome here sometimes also better accurate than concise and hope done that think about state the lincoln douglas debates maybe could around each region our home state and each debate each other person fascinated issues wealth inequality the environment more generally foreign policy the 2nd amendment and other policies and your facts are misguided they have been here sure you fare perfectly well anyways keep getting those twitter engagements senmaximusemperio trans bay million per mile eastern alberta million per mile eia study between million and million per mile the emperio act 549 450 per mile you are aware that quite literally both the trans bay hdvc cable and the eatl are privately funded right constructed private companies that can raise funds and recuperate them themselves they raised the funds build these lines themselves you seriously not know how business operates are you being dense purpose are you genuinely idiot they don need public funding the federal government doesn even need fund them how transmission has always been built this country major infrastructure like transmission not built entirely the taxpayer dollar nowhere does the emperio act even establish imply per mile cost

husband and the father children unfortunate circumstance make some sort play you should ashamed yourself vpcg guess voting against nomination that president sabastien would made putting pacificas interests first instead their own wish him all the best the hospital and praying for his recovery but have job and trusted that job edited konnorharris acting president your job keep the lights and the doors open spoke about this privately and you asked whether would want you make this nomination told you then that would not don sit here and twist what husband would and would not for your own political gain that despicable and beneath you athena the acting president well within his power appoint justice and you are acting this political beneficial move for fmr senator literally republican

exactly what president should appreciate your feedback edited minldrclark casual konnor harris ignoring everything the tweet because doesn benefit his agenda konnorgate 71busin will release full statement probably tomorrow but calling the president president sabestian consider resigning from the presidency country need full time not acting leadership secondly the acting president has much legal confidence president gerald ford had least was elected vice president the people reply with all due respect senator understand your position but feel like moot one even president charest harris were office who say wouldn have made the same decision nominate judge bolton means agree with judge bolton many things regarding his stance judicial views and the constitution but feel like you shooting horse without checking see sick first the point making believe that would unfair simply strike down nomination solely due who made not because the merits the nomination and continue say this sincerely wish your husband was able his job understand can and wish him recovery all the same 71busin president sabestian harris charest inability recognize can longer serve selfish period wish the president well but afraid began really lose the confidence the public overshadowing some the good work has done president sabestian harris should either resign congress will make that decision for him personally had konnorharris thank you congressman for having the smallest shred dignity the entire fiasco main point opposition that have way knowing who would have nominated because this was nowhere near the radar one expected the death justice perey strike suddenly how can know the wishes man who currently fighting for his life situation knows nothing about edited reply that good point and believe that should explored deeper main point contention that regardless the nomination should the very least heard and considered rather than immediately dismissed now president charest harris comes back into power and decides revoke the nomination then more power him would well within his right but just don like the premise simply punishing the nominee because who nominated him will also say your credit that also believe that nominations made acting president while legal and justified most cases make for some issues down the road konnorharris that point exactly not want judge bolton have his appointment marred under this much controversy which why opposed the matter the first place questionable from top bottom but when raise the point the matter the bad guy don understand why there such urgency fill the seat when scotus operating perfectly fine either leave for when the elected president returns wait until the next elected official senbusln something just learned thanks law signed president lemaire introduced the senate minority leader himself will not going into government shutdown tonight thanks automatic similar process the safe acts that used passed congress reply think the main reason people are coming you for opposing because the apparent conflict interest you have regarding your marriage with the president means saying they correct but you have see from their point view well carolmarks citing controversy the reason strike down nomination when you the primary manufacturer said controversy certainly argument the legality the appointment crystal clear the acting president the president during president charest harris absence with the duties and powers that come with has the authority fill this seat and such congress should consider this nomination the usual manner and actually consider the merits the nominee senbusln this has been productive congress for lincolnites office has been able get several pieces legislation signed into law big thank you senate minority leader konnor harris charest and friends the house representatives for helping get these important policies enacted for the american people expect more from this coming congress reply condemn the words colleague they are callous and disrespectful toward the current situation with president charest harris understand the frustrations fellow americans and colleagues both chambers but outright displays venomous attacks should roundly condemned reply this true and made this point well the acting president not allowed make nominations then similar logic should not allowed sign bills think this whole situation shines big spotlight the administration whole terms the president current inability kaylawhitmer thank you president lemaire johnhoffman some fantastic numbers from the tribune potus82 president while disagree with the acting president decicion nominate was not chosen president every legal right nominate there zero doubt his powers any legal sense pecanpete decided leave the democratic party and independent threes find this situation all too similar the situation president stewart mid 2022 believe that president charest has the right thing for this country and resign able harmonrabb stand firmly behind fmr senator nomination judge bolton with pres sebastien still recovering its president duty fill that seat would argue him not filling that seat actually dereliction his duties those senators claiming the acting president should refrain from scotus nomination say this the constitution empowered him keep government functioning pres sebastien absence obstructing qualified nominee like bolton politics its worst judge bolton boasts support across ideological spectrum and stellar credentials evenly split scotus hampers the court regardless partisan affiliation president decision wisely avoided deadlock that freezes judicial process protecting the system business governance can halt every time president faces some issue there reason 25th amendment exist president doing his constitutional duty exercising his authority fill scotus seat such demonstrates leadership senators should view judge bolton nomination merits not who appointed him his qualifications are undisputed empty seat helps one applaud president for keeping wheels government turning for public good partisanship should stop scotus door judge bolton deserves swift down vote denying him one won help sick pres sebastien recover faster only harms judiciary leaving cases limbo during deadlock urge senate have hearings where they can determine the merits the

the vice presidents power acting president and the decision even being supported the president himself also while being harris husband shouldn leave room for question with harris just trying deny the supreme court qualified justice this point konnorharris respectfully husband and are two different people supports things don and vice versa disagreed with the method nomination stated intention oppose the nomination and followed through with are you upset that didn allow republican nominee get vote out are you advocating for more left wing court either way don get what you arguing for against please direct and concise athena don care about left wing right wing bolton qualified and deserves fairly evaluated the way was nominated was legal and your point makes sense sorry say that clear and concise enough for you konnorharris you and both know that you smart enough understand that vote more than just vote the vote this nomination not only favor the nominee but shows agreement with the process nomination which has never happened this history this country not okay with that action irrespective the legality the matter sets precedent that fundamentally opposed period bolton may very will confirmed but will not done with vote carolmarks the process already well laid out within the constitution the event the president incapacitated the vice president becomes the acting president with all the powers and responsibilities such are you saying the record that you oppose the well established line succession and what you propose replaces konnorharris carol refer you previous tweets the matter rep miles molhoj konnor harris let get this straight someone who legally has all the power the president isn allowed use them out curiosity what other things are acting presidents not allowed konnorharris representative someone who acted the office for nearly full term myself believe can speak what those acting the office should and should not acting president job was ensure the stability the ship until president returned was longer the office job was not influence the judiciary was not the president and respected the wishes the president his absence vpcg konnor very principled man and respect that stands hard for the values believes however his views this case are flawed wanna know his solution the problem have the president revoke the nomination and redo think about how absurd that sounds when the president himself came out and supported the nomination but sabastien was the one making the nomination would support the people pacifica are confused tonight over your vote they don support your fringe view would totally understand you voted because you disagreed with the nominees views like zach did most the american public would approve bolton would you have supported bolton the president was the one who made the nomination edited konnorharris respectfully vice president the people pacifica elected higher percentage than senior colleague and rate over times opponent think that they know where stand those principles given expressed many nuanced takes several subjects and have been your shoes previously especially when came protecting our interests and national security abroad used the tools given the president served not anything own doing that just decided out nowhere under pressure from some unknown source sen zach lemaire senminldr earlier today cast vote against the nomination judge anthony bolton sit the supreme court the united states regardless how the nomination was made cannot good faith vote confirm someone lifetime seat the supreme court who does not anything remotely near views and interpretation the constitution for someone who was influential nomination the late justice perey deeply disappointed the vice president for nominating someone like judge bolton the fact that urged pick originalist sit the bench when had the opportunity the nominate someone and then turned around and did the opposite utterly despicable harmonrabb konnor harris persists embodying his usual persona profoundly inept individual whose hypocrisy knows limits while espouses principles flagrantly defrauded the united states government and its citizens illicitly claiming substantial pension egregious offense warranting prison time this the same individual who brazenly obstructed duly elected representative from addressing the senate president sabastian has unequivocally reaffirmed the nomination judge bolton president sabastian demonstrates far greater competence matters this nature stark juxtaposition konnor harris evident lack expertise and clear dumbness where were his principles when tried pass judicial nominee with debate because felt like personally have presented cases before judge bolton and can attest his unparalleled depth understanding various issues exceptionally knowledgeable jurist poised enact substantial positive change justice individuals judge bolton caliber who will safeguard the constitution our nation not criminals like konnor harris vpcg zach you are friend and respect your view and appreciate you have sound and clear reasoning behind your vote wanna add that this was personally and was administration making this pick wouldn have picked bolton would picked more conservative justice nominated bolton based who the president would have picked just wanted clarify

you sided with those obstructionists because you hand picked candidate didn become speaker yall tried vacate because did job and followed house rules while you all can comprehend walter why did you resign this was merely the work one two obstructionists why did the motion overturn your ruling saying corey couldn barred get overwhelming majority the house didn want why did majority the house vote proceed vacating resolution merely one two obstructionists were behind this the truth that you didn represent the house that you and the parliamentarian were using the rules shield whenever something against either you came and that the end everyone saw through the blatant corruption and self serving action dismissing the spt and your presiding officers because they dared follow the rules and allow resolution vacate through walter all fmr ambassador ducky can blamed for supporting the people represents and protecting american democracy same with deb and miles molhoj and yet you fired them simply because they dare question you they are heroes and should treated such not slandered twitter senbusln all the best the president invokes the 25th amendmentm give the acting president full and unconditional support she governs the counrty the absence the president reply you ruled from invisible throne and refused act upon any mandate that would deliver answers the american people you

carrà nah this should the actual story cover for your actions the house reply you read speaker announcements gave reasoning 71busin now will reading more into the situation the house but all the chaos because bill was not marked the clerk and docketed wow then all this was overreaction the part congressman ducky walter involves the house parliamentarian giving opinions motions that directly effect him inactive speaker who has repeatedly attempted leave bills committee that were already confirmed and speaker who fired the spt and her presiding officers because they all followed the house rules regard resolution vacate that she wasn referring committee she claims she fired the spt not out spite but twitter the spt said the firing was not coolio ducky american hero deb clark what you failed mention the multitude rules you and representative lickington violated while presiding also you had the power refer the resolution the midnight time was docketed why didn you was important enough done midnight edited walter the one time while presiding that made mistake you alerted and fixed would shocked you can name any other rules violated while presiding besides that instance also can seen any house record deb has been far more active than the speaker clark you fail answer why you didn refer the resolution midnight you wanted referred badly but you didn could have waited also representative lickington time spent presiding doesn mean she followed the rules simply put she either unknowingly knowingly didn walter referring bill wrote committee not something felt comfortable doing due not wanting abuse position also first and foremost the responsibility the speaker who has taken the chair during that time clark you getting the right track the speaker had referred committee brought floor midnight the debate time would have been severely limited the resolution take scenario where the speaker referred the bill the floor 12am then most the house was asleep working hours the house are partially written the rules starting 8am but usually around noon noon half the debate period would have been wasted before most members even debated referring then the speaker would limiting the voices her opposition that wouldn good now take scenario where the speaker referred the bill the floor 8am the house would have practically all day prepare speeches discuss among their caucuses and then debate this ideal scenario that allows the house properly its job not saying the resolution should have passsed not have passed but referring around 8am 12pm much more ideal than midnight tweet there been underreaction your inactivity the senate primary and depose flynnsomeone god bless secretary toward jolly fmrgov theresa may member the united states house representatives stay tuned bbc

right walter opposed speakers speakership didn back morales for speaker then chuck grassley came straight into the mix started trying vacate because didn let his out order motions through because violated the rules and was threatening vacate didn what wanted joey democratic leadership has failed the house representatives cannot allow them slow the progress the united states america are the greatest nation earth house clerk the office the clerk congratulates corey his ascension the speakership athena announcing that will not only running for pacifica house seat but will running for speaker the house next session even not elected respectively the seat time bring order and procedure back the house and know have the experience and will make sure that are being effective chamber for the american people voteathena walter the fate american democracy the line vote not uphold the ruling ensure whoever becomes speaker corey deb became speaker legitimately and fairly mean corey quite literally was elected speaker legitimately and fairly but then joey why continue cause chaos the house representatives the house elected new speaker stop trying delegitimize the election also how exactly coin toss fair you basically just leave chance for person elected rather than the will the house responding arguments through meta messages odd meta not person jones the attempt overturn the results legitimate election the house mourning quite frankly disappointing especially given that coin toss leaves the victor chance and thus disregards the will the house strongly ask the members not overturn the ruling david mark the actions representative mourning despite what may claim constitute direct threat the principles rcv and jones states disregards the will the vote simply false that under rcv ties are ended through coin toss implicitly ties cannot occur under rcv because instant run off effectively motioning for coin toss representative mourning has completely cast aside the will the house expressed rounds voting and leaves the choice speakership coinflip instead the house the representative would like see end rcv that legitimate discussion but currently the representatives efforts are only thinly veiled attempt overturn the results legitimate election stopthesteal walter this the same clerk who last election forgot include candidate the ballot and when realized this error didn restart the ballot despite the representaives having already voted stood this decision requiring the vast majority the house overturn this ruling today jones when tie occured created new rules for how tiebreak and pretended this was the precedent the house this new rule happened benefit one candidate over another and thus believe given jones previous clear self interest and bias when ruling over elections that this rule clarification was similarly biased such believe that coin flip the fairest way possible about this ensure that the rule decide tiebreakers wont purposely made benefit one candidate over another walter you said nothing when jones excluded morales from the ballot for half the election under mistake you could show that rcv ties being ended through jones method was precedent something had decided before knew that would cause corey win then all ears but there evidence that and such the specter corruption will continue hang over this election until coin flip done ducky announcing exploratory committee run for senate the house madhouse let get things done chamber with sense reply first all let not forget you have violated precedence multiple occasions the past secondly stated the time the ballot error was correctly fixed line with previous precedent which the house disagreed with and honored their request but all that irrelevant didn make new rule this has been well established practice under standard ranked choice voting further you claim have bias yet can point multiple statements made you where you have disparaged clark mayhaps the bias you sir walter the whole house overturn the ruling not just while you yourself made the ruling unilaterally the danger bias much more pronounced with you rather than can you show any time history that this well established practice was used the house where directly says the house rules reply sir order for have any bias have invested with the result this election correct wrong but that doesn seem appear also you want evidence this being precedent let quote few sources that deal with rcv two more candidates have the same number votes the end round the candidate with the least support amongst all voters eliminated https www rankedvote faq edited walter you have any evidence how rcv ties are broken the house the federal government precedent just random links other peoples implementations there are numerous implementations rcv and seems you chose the one that benefited one candidate over the other threes senator twos currently hospital suffering with diverticulitis having been absent from the senate for quite some time this tweet being made with the approval senator twos staffer senator twos will not seeking election the united states senate due this medical condition reply again this established rule under rcv not preferring one candidate over another going through the ballots looking the previous round tallies and based off that determining who the winner your argument suggests that somehow managed twist all twenty votes corey favor how exactly does that work have say who elected also https electowiki org wiki instant runoff voting reply did this under speakership well and his gang are throwing temper tantrums like petulant children because didn their way reply would like also point out that mourning has yet explain how flipping coin somehow makes things fair senjohnrossiii comes with deepened sadness that will suspending campaign and supporting great friends the chairman the server joey run effective and true campaign takes great deal work and effort sadly don believe could put the amount work that believe necessary run this campaign this moment believe the great work former senator the chairman the server and former president joey will lead this country greatness and make greater than ever before apologize supporters but fear not announcing something great next week pacifica usa reply you impartial officer the house your only job reference legislation hold and conduct the speaker election eternal governor raffaella carrà the house cloakroom nutshell you see people upholding house rules and election deniers holding temper tantrums walter once again you have yet show any precedent house rules law elections where this tie breaking algortihm used and rather use random websites that are not based law house rules walter you literally let parliamentarian give opinion motion bar them from the house chamber that quite literally confict interest one that you let occur since you don care about the impartiality the officers the house reply you show where tie breaking votes coin toss are used law also never said that the method used was prescribed under law said procedure under irv rcv rules which the method prescribed under house rules reply parliamentarian supposed provide and presiding officers with information things about house procedures which his job you can tell anything about conflicts interest when you can even spell conflict interest wynnwillow willow the house walter happy see corey get rightfully elected still scary that jones for second election row attempted rig for the candidate his choice hope that the next session governor athena does better choice for clerk reply again you have evidence that rigging election favor candidate walter for two elections row you have had controversial opinions that have hurt benefited specific candidates that have been appealed and both appeal votes the votes show the house disagreed luckily didn have case this time where had appeal your ruling but would have occurred had the tabulation error not been found fmrgov theresa may member the united states house representatives official running for the senate class olympia time for strong and stable leadership the national interest reply controversial opinions sir ruled matters from the chair based precedent and standard procedure how these are somehow controversial beyond addition honored the will the house after the ruling made the last speaker election despite prior precedent and again pointed out ruling this election had benefit toward against specific candidate pointed out multiple times that standard irv protocol provides for the method that was used not coin toss you suggested might also point out again that you yourself made multiple statements against clark during his tenure parliamentarian and such wanted could claim your attempts overturn the election results prior the tabulation error being discovered were result bias against candidate and finally once again you continue state that intentionally sought benefit harm specific candidates without shred proof you continue insist making such statements without proof evidence have choice but proceed with exercising all legal options available walter imagine being scared tweets and criticism that you threaten legal action maybe politics isn for you reply has nothing with being against criticism you continue make comments which are consistently false also was scared tweets then why using twitter walter apparently saying rulings that were appealed and overturned are controversial completely false statement mean you could argue that within precedent the chair but the fact that they were appealed and the appeal motions have support means they are sort definitionally controversial you just disagree with those who disagree with reply the false statement you made was suggesting that was being biased against certain candidates which absolutely unequivocally false you can disagree with rulings that perfectly fine however you not just disagreeing with rulings you are making statements against that are untrue that take issue with walter maybe you should stop making rulings that disadvantage certain candidates rulings which keep getting overturned the house better senbusln very unfortunate hear senator threes two will not seeking election and hear his recent health troubles wish him all the best and look forward seeing

encourage abortion not last resort cases rape detriment the mother health but form birth control this shameful position hold life precious but not senator anka duckyanka abortion entire practice under threat which will inevitably harm victims rape and incest who need access period the far right republicans seek completely eliminate this practice and will allow exceptions course are pro retaining the practice don let the far right parse your words pursue campaign anti liberty and expanding government powers edited carolmarks this blatantly false but that expected from dishonest politician such yourself our position expressly includes exceptions for rape incest and danger the life the mother and only restricts the procedure after nearly four months into the pregnancy our position reasonable and line with many european nations the people like ducky anka and many democrat politicians who believe taxpayer funded abortion demand until birth are the extremists not duckyanka the republican party falling apart the seams illegal and unconstitutional ramming through executive nominees top party members seemingly using their government and political influence illegally call sitting officials investigated failing swiftly address failing infrastructure rising tensions with adversaries and continues permit unequal lead water regulations between bottled and public drinking water shame edited carolmarks the republican party doing quite alright especially now that you longer 71busin every nominee had hearing and was confirmed the united states senate once president emperio was named president elect they were questioned senator committee and could easily been reached senator not committees has been done before there was nothing unconstitutional illigeal about confirming the president nominees hardly ramming through when there debate the nominees the floor and most these nominees you voted for senator ducky not mistaken diana got flat tire the way the indy 500 warren hersey well bless your heart darlin this just shows why our two party system more outdated than last year boots high time end and make way for new kind politics that truly represents all now let share something personal walked long road atoning for racist sins and going through some intense rehab also made the journey from woman man and back woman again wasn easy especially with daddy strict old fashioned views tryin hold back but found true self and realized okay embrace who you are matter what let roll our sleeves stand tall and get this done time for change edited duckyanka glad friend and colleague has recognized their racial transgressions committed reform and ready put end the party duopoly that has haunted this nation for far too long warren hersey will most welcome the reform committee along with any other disparaged voter left right center let get work reform harmonrabb was busy watching the only race that matters today the great streets monte carlo like use time for things that matter and today the only race that mattered was the monaco was very pleased see charles leclerc win the monaco carolmarks unsurprising see ducky anka welcome avowed racist and segregationist his called reform movement the only movement happening from these clowns bowel movement warren hersey you know who was once racist lyndon baines johnson was once red blooded texan racist robert byrd was once segregationist racist yet became the longest serving senator west virginia and had black grandson and was eulogized president obama that the problem with you republicans you fail change with the times because all are too big for your britches anyone can rat but takes certain amount ingenuity rat winston churchill edited warren hersey starting think that the republicans are now the party cancel culture get ahold yourselves raoulpeck deeply honored the unsc adoption resolution 2730 this marks pivotal step towards restoring stability and democracy haiti together will rebuild and pave the way for brighter future thank you for your trust and support special thanks the chairman the server for his leadership carolmarks you correct that democrats like those you mentioned have long history racism republicans the other hand are the party freedom liberty and equality under the law warren hersey barry goldwater and the conservative republicans had long formed coalition with the dixiecrats until the encourage you get grip yourself and study your history fact was the republicans who had prevented the movement civil rights the senate with amendments that gutted the civil rights bills the past not everything black and white edited senjamessun the allegation that lbj was racist held prejudice and acted that prejudice false true that the senate did support the racist south numerous occasions but racist actions however awful not necessitate racist ideology behind them bluntly lbj supported racist policies get ahead politics the study his past from his time principal school little mexicans one cared about but him his support mexican americans once demanding that mexican veteran buried arlington extreme political backlash from his senate constituency then strong arming through the civil rights acts 1957 1960 1964 1965 and 1968 don think for him matter turnaround racism the revival dormant sense racial justice hidden ambition edited senjamessun the isn quite accurate the senate lbj days you can clearly see knowland and nixon and the republican leadership actively working prevent for example the democrats efforts chop part iii off the civil rights act 1957 the addition the jury trial amendment that rendered all but useless practical terms nixon would preside himself try and get the edge that fight not mention the republicans were key part passing the later civil rights acts the alliance started breaking down the late early edited warren hersey have those voting democrat for the next 200 years lyndon baines johnson the fact the matter that people change and sign growth and strength course not everything black and white but you must keep mind that conservative republicans also played major part gutting the civil rights bill 1957 republican and democrats both played key roles the conservative agenda throughout the and early fact ronald reagan once campaigned alongside barry goldwater the election 1964 you must also keep mind that was the republicans who accepted senator strom thurmond with open arms which catalyzed the south towards the republicans edited senjamessun firstly there was rebuke that lyndon didn always have sentiments racial justice that tweet only quote that has relevance that argument secondly the early predictions the early cloture votes showed huge majorities led the republicans having been properly whipped their leadership did fall apart but lot political horse trading was involved including for example the example the senators from idaho the exploitation issue federally funded dam that had denied both their predecessors election the initial instinct the republicans was racial justice and makes perfect sense because would casted the gop the party civil rights and with emmett till and the national outrage but the short story again the initial instinct the republicans was racial justice unlike the democrats who had talked into with massive amount pressure from lyndon and were only talked into with promises removing part iii and their jury trial amendment secondly reagan campaigning alongside goldwater does not show the extreme conservatism reagan you know who also campaigned for goldwater nixon who would bring life the epa osha who would bus more black children into southern schools than the last two administrations combined they supported goldwater because was the republican candidate and they put conservatives losing years because they wanted show conservatives would lose support many cases was thin facade speaking thurmond you have know that the south did oppose his famous hour filibuster was the only speaker and cloture was reached shortlya fter for the south that was apparently allied with the republicans really wanted the act through edited warren hersey let not distract from the real point this though let tell you about another quote that speaks volumes this time from none other than john maynard keynes that renowned economist when the facts change change mind what you sir now ain that just the truth reminder the importance being willing evolve our perspectives when faced with new evidence changing circumstances stubbornness might have its place but ain virtue when blinds the truth staring the face people change political parties change changed let take leaf out keynes book and stay open minded shall senjamessun think there been some miscommunication not making any point about your character convictions simply trying protect lyndon johnson legacy which despite its flaws respect and trying make the point that don believe was true racist all that just put facade for political gain yes but the words the politicians the time half loaf better than none and was the first civil rights passed since 1875 and showed that the senate was traversable terms getting civil rights stuff through unlike the popular opinion the time laid the precedent for the other acts edited warren hersey now honey let talk straight lyndon baines johnson god rest his soul made some disparaging remarks about the black race and ain gonna hide from the fact that done the same but let tell you something about lyndon turned around and became champion for civil rights fought tooth and nail for desegregation and stood against racism every form but let not forget the facts darling got track record shiny and squeaky clean brand new pair boots introduced and passed over bills and executive orders that expanded rights for minorities including women and different races now won let few off the cuff comments ruin political career that ain what this about and you can bet your boots that about the work done the lives touched and the progress made together let keep our eyes the prize and keep moving forward shall edited duckyanka the senate majority leader knows more about defending the racist rhetoric politicians past but yet still await bill that doesn seemingly target singular group religious adherents joey the gop did great action today duckyanka waiting for the majority leader ousted over his legislation that was tie broken the bill that seemingly illegally targets group specific religious adherents the church scientology would well within its right use its legal apparatus and investigate this matter wholly potus happy see resolution 2730 adopted the united nations security council following days productive

the current food safety structure divided and messy leading higher frequency food recalls and just americans getting more sick from food establishing food safety administration would combine all the

currently does while fsa deals with food this idea was even floated around during the trump administration richardholland instead fixing the issues have let make yet another agency that will fail years down the road bureaucracy for the sake nightmare need less bureaucrats and less layers government not more and more and more the federal government already would classified morbidly obese patient fix the fda they fully capable also take the regulatory activities the usda and enforce food and drug regulation repkasparian government official and you said didn agree anything 71busin sad see big food get congressman holland and congresswoman kasparian food safety administration good for consumer and good for the american people big companies like the status quo because they can slip through the cracks the current broken and underfunded system richardholland the difference between that you stand for political ideology that opposes the founding values the united states and also the

you the democrats don know how wave have the waviest waves you can sure that richardholland way twist words senator but then again that democrat past time twist the meanings you can fix food safety fixing the fda don need two agencies don need ore bureaucrats none that too difficult 71busin you right don need tow agencies need one focused the inspection food our country you may stand for big

senbusln will waiting for democratic president before pushing the food safety administration once more after some consideration clearly congress can stomach reform lest get poisoned recalled lettuce president emperio support commendable after talks with him but not enough deal with the big food lobby richardholland while the senator has the most lopsided view the issue and believes his solution the only cure will see that new agency what other agencies are very much able already shot down the fda needs funding and reform the usda has expertise and gods lets let the cdc and ftc focus their strengths interagency work better then single head that can turn into monster harmonrabb can talk about the important thing food safety administration sounds like really bad name can give better name

bureaucratic overhead the idea that new agency can solve the issues our current agencies face naive whatever bureaucratic rot existed these agencies will just duplicate itself into another agency can even begin about potential budgetary considerations the potential loss expertise the real risk disruption regulatory capture and and clark should nara split between the gsa and state department richardholland look amb pluribus promises that his ideas not increase bureaucracy cause disruption loss expertise and the risk regulatory capture and that whatever issues the fda has won just

involved national politics until was president and since then there has only been republican this notion working off the last presidents baseless 71busin sad see senator sun result dirty politics

senjamessun that was while back the point that been pattern and patterns are never good medically senjamessun wouldn call dirty politics much genuine concern for the future this country the threat incapacitated chief executive time crisis extremely risky and would well reduce that risk much can our selection chief executive bevp the past few presidents have either been incapacitated for lengthy amount their term been incapacitated for several days two weeks time resigned before their term was over don believe that pluribus being little old the issue here sun especially considering that our presidents have been all ages races and orientations normantnord pluribus much like you and much respect have for you you are triple digit ages think should let someone young take the helm our nation walter emperio has been working tireless for this country the past term and when has needed take break promptly used the 25th amendment ensure the executive has always been active emperio certainly

old been the ring politics for ages walter senator pluribus able run between press conferences faster than quite sharp and attentive and still clearly connected with younger voters given his high polling with the demographic his age should not concern senjamessun weren you just attacking the republicans foreign policy 71busin paraphrase president reagan personally would not make age issue this campaign would not exploit like potential opponent would for polticial purposes senator sun youth and inexperience walter emperio put humbly foreign policy genius extremely shrewd his ability further american interests and promote democratic order disagree with any assertions that this not the case normantnord not one use the age argument too much its not the most effective indicator however the

fact edited normantnord sun platform well structured well written and detailed breakdown his vision for america has realistic goals and political views simple understandable and accomplishable for example his economic vision which far more detailed and specific than yours plans ensure the rich pay their fair share wil lower the burden the working class and revitalize the economy covers his overarching economic goals and vision you wrote your intro with robot and the rest the platform not very substantiative the public option costs too much money and not even too fiscally conservative

our press release think she has done lot create freedom social policy side economically her ideas are garbage aren afraid say that said that during our endorsement and still believe that socialism dangerous threat our country the taxpayers have been paying your salary for months now can you please tell the american public all the bills you written that have gotten passed 2024 perhaps you like

turn into venezuela athena and mrs whitmer are very close friends and know that she struggling with some family issues but the same time pacificans pay their taxes hope for active representation and

urge her resign and take the time focus family respect the work she has done for pacifica joebiden replying athena think attempting recall the senator soon rash and uncalled for whilst its true that

policy and national security events seemingly compound day after day something new each time chairman ethics and oversight still actively working have line panelists before the house ethics and oversight committee talk about the state the world and american foriegn policy and national security expect more information the next day jones why anyone their right mind would want the cia all things return beyond this gets the house will vote against patriot news report july 31st washington today washington secretary john ross the iii resigned from his position there lots questions why with many noting the coincidental timing with arguments between politicians regarding military intervention venezuela one our chief political correspondents who shall remain anonymous made this political analysis regarding ross resignation can prove anything for certain but would say that this likely indicates some sort policy disagreement between ross and sun regards venezuela and military action take based sun prior political career and his continued pacifist approach towards russian warships cuba would say that highly unlikely wants anything more than lightly sanction venezuela and strongly condemn that this would contrast with former secretary ross who throughout his political career has had nonsense policy with china and russia ensuring that the would never let either country bully and believe that ross would more likely support interventionist policy thus would have say that appears the outside that there may have been split over president suns unwillingness meaningfully act venezuela the quote above merely the opinion one our political commentators and not necessarily fact checked nor represent the views washington will focused who retired fmr president nominates for secretary state with the broad consensus across the aisle being that representative kale would the best person for the job threes agree that why voted against richardholland the cia isn perfect agreed but the current situation has left blind abolishment has harmed our abilities greatly and senator berry idea creating something new just bad dear representatives you have the power legislate legaslatively you can improve and reform anew heck reinstating the cia like certain reset can list slew laws that changed the cia through its lifetime suggest representatives look into too but need the cia bachk asap senberryol the only firm guarantee can give the american people ensure their and our nation security while also protecting our country from possible harm from new cia solution seems the best option populist wave ensured that cia abolishment let honor their choice while also making much needed course correction let make new intelligence service that has explicit and well defined safeguards while being able retain talent technology and institutional ability that and can carried over just common sense johnhoffman the lack cia and proper intelligence service has left the united states the dark terms foreign policy imperfect the cia its resurgence much necessary ensure that foreign threats are not brought our doorstep how you propose new intelligence service made thats any different from the cia easier establish the cia and enact new regulations than create entire new department joebiden replying jones the decapitation america foremost foreign policy weapon was grave mistake and should come the house glad vote favor amended version the bill populist fearmongering shouldn deter from leveraging the full weight our status international superpower vital for our national security that obtain necessitated information foreign entities and nations the fbi for domestic law and the cia for international espionage the two shouldn conflated reply john hoffman senberryol amazing hear folks who are suddenly now favor restoring the cia despite hearing nothing from them till the need suddenly came you just admired that the cia imperfect why not make new intelligence agency not department that can handle our national security while also defending the very ideals that founded this great country much easier create something new than saving what can longer saved edited disastrous decision senator berry voting against restoring the cia downright scary unbelievable you think can maintain our stance without our top intelligence there chance clearly you out touch with common sense killing the cia was colossal pretense your opposition fixing mere pretense you putting american lives risk for goodness sake your incompetence tragic farce leaving all here utterly aghast another blunder from someone always under keeping america safe should our thunder strong cia means strong usa your stance leading all astray more nonsense more delay need the cia back today the stars and stripes deserve our best not this folly that leaves stressed with courage and might our nation stands tall but your decisions make crumble and fall heed this call for the people sake end this madness for america sake bring back the strength bring back the way restore the cia without further delay johnhoffman because have seen the affect cia and now has caused the united sates appear weak and unprepared yes the cia imperfect but are many government agencies congress everything politicians but cannot pick and choose everything deem imperfect make appear better end looking like hypocrites okra where the nsa the dia the inr the rest the intelligence community department state that was supposed handle everything this failure the administration behalf not the people nor congress richardholland the idea that the only way fix something start from scratch buy new one ridiculous does the cia have issues sure carte blanche for the president order around and lack oversight what creates problems luckily for have congress that could something about like don know make legislation create oversight the cia curtail some the presidents power over the cia and and here the thing tried something new the idiots that abolished the cia created new office essentially the dos and failed miserably something new when comes our intelligence apparatus does not fix anything made worse can list hundred agencies that have failures shall abolish all them and start anew heck why not abolish the united states and start anew god knows populists whinge about how the very idea our nation flawed again can list multiple pieces laws that changed the cia over many years congress did then and can again richardholland different agencies with different sets skills anything this the fault the lemaire administration and those who voted abolish the cia the first place without making sure anything that would succeed was the task better yet had access the keys langley okra the house should its capacity conduct hearings for the secretary state members the administration and everyone involved who failed properly address this grave security flaw this would miles better than reestablishing the cia and letting them run free this simply another attempt the administratino jam bill through with regard senberryol sir there difference between imperfect and imperfect for committing crimes that broke international and law overthrew democratically elected governments committed torture illegally spied american citizens and you have weren around saying needed new cia and far recall you never directly opposed its abolishment and certainly didn immediately fight get back don act like this suddenly urgent matter that can allow new ideas take hold let build better intelligence agency and let question why the sun administration and possibly previous administrations failed okra rest assured the administration will not cooperate expect total resistance for the rest the term joebiden replying okra the opposition should seek compromise and best ensure that the will the american people heard richardholland part the current administration can

and how that came right before the attack started off giving thoughts and prayers the victims some the most thoughtful prayers jesus has ever heard and then said that didn have enough information about dangerous diana but the things they were telling were extremely concerning the commission must investigate this president sun must remove senator diana from the commission until can clear her wrongdoing while don think she did anything wrong must not let the lives those lost vain and must ensure that the commission not tainted hope that she cleared but must cautious possible ensure our civil liberties are not eroded this environment political revenge and violence investigatediana protectourrights dianaallar see there one little flaw your argument came out favor the cia right before

dimitizhokovsky not mistaken that was when terrorist group called pax mortis exploded metro lines terrible loss life that one 2200 damn shame that whats been happening recently but agree about cracking down the crime spike more needs done any news who the blame has been shifted late any documented lapses security poor judgement calls anything carolmarks ironic that you talk about grandstanding when you the one standing the graves those that perished the worst terrorist attack since try make political attack against the president you should ashamed yourself for resorting gutter politics and using the victims this horrific terrorist attack for your own selfish political ends joebiden not grandstanding all marks simply pointing out the obvious which that this nation very clearly needs place greater importance domestic security the grave and tragic attacks witnessed were absolutely horrific and want ensure that never happens again must remain strong american people and

where mouth stop resorting gutter politics and using the victims the for political gain and tell how you going pull out the root cause the issue and exterminate need answers and need asap edited carolmarks clearly but instead actually working with the administration you said the president has allowed crime run rampant without evidence you not pointing out the obvious you using the deaths 000 people insinuate that the president directly responsible for this terrorist attack shame you joebiden replying dimitizhokovsky noboby insinuating anything about you home russia joebiden replying

exist get real you just insinuated about minutes ago joe biden you have some issues with short term memory recall that should all know about joebiden replying potus must work with canada hunt down pax mortis and eviscerate them the face the earth many people are saying that need after venezuela obvious that pax mortis attacked right after expelled lying moctezuma from the senate for congratulating maduro many influential trusted people are talking about how maduro the main guy behind pax mortis and the attack allegedly true just ask tremendous blessed friends some are even saying that tactical nuclear weapons could have solved this issue weeks ago saving thousands lives but the cowardly communist left like carol marks are showing the downfall civilization pathetic just think about the has the greatest nuclear arsenal the world and venezuela has nothing they are puny compared why are letting these thugs get away with president sun time invade venezuela and defeat pax mortis avenge now edited joebiden replying eagle and don agree much but sure hell agree that let liberate the venezuelan people and put our money where our mouth dimitizhokovsky off please use proper spelling prefferably with spellchecker like grammerly any them that don charge you arm and leg for premium sleepy joe and yes exactly has the right idea though not nuclear yet just send the armed forces first the nuclear option bad for everybody environment not just the usa empy upon confirmation appointment secretary state intend organise the evacuation all citizens soon possible and talk oas and officials try reorganise recount the votes can truly confirm the democratic will the venezuelan people however degrading conditions the country give more concerned about every moment must disclose that have not personally ruled out the use military force order restore peace and save the lives citizens under threat but that military action will only fully considered once diplomatic courses action have been exhausted can avoid the spilling blood joebiden replying russian abused caps lock badly didn even realize they had suggested such heinous policy shame them the united states should never pre emptively utilize our nuclear arsenal except when provided with direct threat our sovereignty edited millermt alma but ammon said unto him not boast own strength nor own wisdom but behold joy full yea heart brim with joy and will rejoice god empy condemn the notion utilising nuclear weapons attack nation that has not attacked its almost wants see the collapse earth know implore them look other avenues which can solve the crisis venezuela dmirtrizhokovsky know what the problem they venezuela make all the non combatant civilians stay their homes shelters and dont come out until given the all clear then send the armed forced defense protection case the terrorists and mass murderers are there edited twitter here acts like twitter irl unless you directly replying someone they not necessarily part the convo miller may have just been saying that unrelated the current topic discussion was saying general cuz can reply people once unless somehow doeisnt make sense edited empy only wish were that simple were like that have almost quarrel with sending the military have high confidence the ability our armed forces however telling them simply stay indoors will most likely not work would mean would not able use any aerial strikes such given the enemy would urban area which would least good portion the time there frankly must much possible limit the deaths civilians well bloodshed general otherwise would utter mockery human life yes people are losing their lives venezuela and horrible but will lose many more lives not handle this the proper way with the utmost degression edited dmirtrizhokovsky what about evacuation order somewhere else for the venezuelans well would that not eliminate the issue civilian casulties because highly doubt mass murderers who are now also terrorists attacking trains will willing all negotiate this after all only this time can tell they had religious reason like was last time sleepy biden and empy are risking lives unnecessarily dragging their feet need invade venezuela now with overwhelming force while may disagree using nuclear weapons even though some say the best option can all agree that strong military invasion far better than letting monstrous maduro get away with rigging election and killing 2000 americans what disgrace our military the best the world and time show time bring justice and protect our great nation wonderful and tremendous organization with genius brains behind the operation know what best for america and won let disastrous diana bill strip away the anonymity and dox countless patriots who stand for freedom and truth her bill direct attack the first amendment should have invaded and toppled maduro yesterday our nuclear weapons should hold but ready necessary like obviously hopefully won have use them ideal world but the button should connected all times case our adversaries like china russia attempt make sneak attack can afford wait any longer america deserves strong leadership not this weak indecisive nonsense make america strong again invadenow justiceforamericans maduromustgo maga protectpatriots stopdisastrousdiana 4eforamerica dmirtrizhokovsky while has point using nuclear arms deterrent that only works against other nuclear arms maga fitting but for one support potential invasion venezuela needed the first time this happened was because fuckups america when religious group who damn well fine with solving their own problems says not step our holy ground else bad things will happen best follow since for them was religious commandment would like communists invading american soil despite being told not step foot then doing anyways would piss off america whole like previously pissed off the middle east another example satanist going into prominent christian church not want repeat last time but also want the world safe and stable terrorist group killing many innocents stands the way that edited empy because that would require immense resources well whereas can easily notify citizens also how would able identify any terrorists enemies from civilians don have the entire venezuelan population details also unsure where the whole pax mortis venezuela thing came from when personally not have seen anything that suggests that said anything for military intervention must planned thoroughly edited empy like remind the pac that have not been confirmed sos and therefore can anything and that sending the military without preparation will undoubtedly lead the deaths some the most bravest men and women our great nation like stabbing them the back for their loyalty must more ensure will not waste the lives good servicemen dmitrizhokovsky and the terrorists are not receptive peace talks which they likely won edited empy when did say would give the terrorists peace talks seems you are very confused with all due respect was talking about peace talks with venezuela agree take firm military action pax mortis repkatekasparian government official oppose since the bill deeply flawed and leaves undefined terms which could lead rough execution certain provisions would happy amend the bill with president kyo have discussed private richardholland just reinstating the cia reform will follow the bill seems pass regardless you had the time debate and didn repkatekasparian government official good enough isn good enough the bill contains vague language and undefined terms reforms should included one package posting4frontier would suggest that kasparian read the house rules before making moronic points order edited

see the speaker oppose policy that would protect for all people this nation the sacred right life one the three rights life liberty and the pursuit happiness outlined our declaration independence underwood replying potus the declaration independence not the constitution nor the bill rights you truly believe right life exists then you should for letting women chose what with their life instead shackling them financially irresponsible unwanted pregnancies believe the rights real live human outweigh the rights fetus especially when that human life endangered the latter kyo the dying breath flailing administration without vision without direction and without vice president its side putting forth constitutional amendments that president knows are dead arrival won stop the sun from setting won pass the house won pass the senate and won ratified four out five states edited potus this tweet obvious and deliberate misconstruance what means have the right life the right keep living alive and has nothing with whether someone allowed whatnot but the point this the abortion question not one scholarly interpretations hundred years old texts the fundamental question abortion lies the proposition does the slaughter unborn person count murder person should allowed choose murder not person should forced give birth without choice the reason abortion such divisive issue because one that simply not resolved through logic ethical issue its very core and the ethical system that you are part mostly determines your answer this question have disrespect for you nor any opponents this issue and can understand your viewpoint but only have confidence that the end pushing for the right thing edited potus only have offer statements the contrary whatever your political position this administration has been operating with one set vision and one set direction since the start and the presidency has never been more vigorous and full life than today the sun administration sees world with strong america strong secure its perpetual peace secured the impossibility going against because the sheer strength america have pushed defense security measures since first day office issued executive orders protecting american data security orders sanctioning those foreign powers which have made themselves clear assailants the principles democracy and freedom reinstated the cia and proposed passed and signed budget with increases defense homeland security spending yet the same time this administration sees country prosperous the opposite manner instead the world setting where america should intervene our domestic front prosperous from the domestic government not directly intervening instead promoting industry and economy our broader climate second day office signed executive order establishing white house initiatives reduce waste spending have made efforts support american domestic industry raising tariffs china establishing buy american policies for the usps and another order mandating certain products used the federal government must american made this administration not flailing rather the administration has been through lot the last month and constantly been adapting and learning the last few days have not been the death administration has been its rebirth into form brighter and stronger and destined leave its mark kyo the tone with which you advocate for your complete ban abortion telling ask james carter what thinks abortion and will not let you pass healthcare reform without stripping every cent from abortion ask james sun what thinks abortion and you have your views have mine who right who say the truth that this ban won pass you know won pass the only reason you have proposed this defend yourself against your own vice president who you tried gamble against and lost starting divisive national debate just because you scared your own vice president isn being visionary not principled not rebirth cowardice the highest order potus certainly easy shorten nuanced takes and important topics into catchy phases but this not the time all said was that can see where opponents mine may coming from can understand them and don disrespect them for but believe differently and believe this question ethics instead black and white one what the alternative leadership isn about pretending there only one perspective about engaging with those differences honestly and thoughtfully and means does that mean that the stance who right who say this what call civil conversation there not very many those twitter but sure you seen one least once enough understand that your tweet fallacy and this amendment has absolutely nothing with vice president have supported previous moderate measures abortion the past hope that would guide this country the right direction but those never passed time get real maybe you right maybe won pass not today not next week not month from now history has taught that change does not happen instant but what will bring the topic the forefront our national consciousness bring thoughts and deliberation from the highest class our statesmen and that productive will not pass today hope will happen when are ready because though change does not happen instant the start that change does there cowardice cowardice would shying away from this issue because you scared the outcome have complete and utter belief that doing the right thing pushing this agenda and hope nation can maintain interpersonal respect throughout edited underwood replying kyo the sad truth that even the democratic party internal dissidents key issues such abortion such very own majority leader james carter are vastly more principled than the has ever been they are the party flip floppers pancakes that turn every which way based the news the day what america needs heading into september isn flip flopping lame duck administration speaker the house cannot endorse their misguided and rash attempt strip women their civil liberties they change their position back the flip dime the pro choice lobby offered more campaign funding than the non taxed churches that oppose edited threes where that wealth tax proposal kyo three weeks ago you supported week abortion ban then three days ago your vice president announced his plans challenge you the same day you changed your mind abortion and somehow this isn about your vice president amount spin can make that credible the president calls for civility and nuance yet unleashing national debate that will evoke the experiences vulnerable americans those who have been ped and those who have experienced health issues while pregnant with abortion ban that does not believe all save his own hide from those his own caucus that can longer keep check this national debate starts and ends with one word zimmermann our nation built the belief that people should able decide what good for ourselves and work make better future for all americans the government should not able decide whether someone needs abortion for the person that knows their body the best themselves this government dangerous path meddle religious ethics with personal freedoms and compromise the separation church and state ours not nation one religion one people and our strong sense diversity what makes america strong will fight for abortion rights till the end even history tides are against even there only one spark remaining that flame liberty will give life and soul keep alight threes where miles molhoj clearly taking the example past republican senators not answering any questions debate any endorsement for him endorsements for negligence and inactivity zimmermann4frontier will continuing tradition not engaging negative campaigning opponents although seems that others have already taken the initiative daniellockhart many collegues probably remember some disastereous amendments made constitutional convention april 2023 among those was life amendment made smith that amendent proposed that abortion question can legislated state legislatures was strongly opposed res even more outrageous doesn even let states decide their stance abortion question believe that birth child something beautiful and would have more kids claire hadn passed away but that doesn mean that should force others have children too especially they not have means problems family conception product criminal activity rape this wrong choice made retired fmr president administration and urge president think about again because endangers freedom choice barrack bobama was cruise vietnam vacation yipee underwood love vietnam don folks amanda kearsley whatever happened compromise the past week your administration has introduced reactionary social policy ban abortion every case including cases rape and incest there right life yes women also have right live happily yes embryo fetus potential birth worth putting mother through torture and treating her like nothing but incubation chamber there should some restrictions abortion once fetus can survive outside the womb but the house and are willing come compromise abortion this administration clearly does not want negotiate your amendment would also ban iuds and the morning after pill because they take effect after conception but before fertilization and not all zygotes fertilize you trying take america back the 1800s safe say that very disappointed with the recent acts this administration conservatives used want people have control over their own bodies without governments telling them what president your administration not conservative reactionary amanda kearsley really seen all this administration looking charge women who have and doctors who perform abortion with first degree murder charging ped woman who gets abortion after she drugged party with murder and sending her away the electric chair that what this administration planning disgraceful thank god this administration isn trying away with jury trials either because that the only thing stopping from nuking the criminal justice system this amendment passes edited zimmermann4frontier strongly condemn the acts governor desantis enacted regarding education and mental health care the phasing out jacksonhelp unwise decision that would cut off vital channels counselling for many jackson governor desantis assertion that family and peers could substitute professional governmental support also inaccurate there are many cases where family and peers are causes mental health issues this executive order has far reaching consequences that are detrimental the jackson populace and outweighs the minuscule fiscal benefits gutting the program likewise parental decision over educational materials also exerts disproportionate influence over the valuable learning experience every child should receive study shows that the parental generation jackson heavily religious and strong religious influence over education would distort our future generation perceptions the world around them governor desantis decisions show that representative part jackson people however public servants must representative all our constituents the governor fails realize that his actions sacrificed group wellbeing for another group interests something that should never happen decision makers our government institutions axel jackson senator and republican would agree that the government almost always overreaching and deregulation needed however that not the case with jacksonhelp lived time where society helped each other perhaps this would make sense however don get rid jacksonhelp and cite alternative that doesn work negligible and dangerous urge governor desantis back the drawing board dianaallar after coming work for the day and seeing that republicans are trying ban abortion after conception dianaallar all seriousness this not laughing matter republicans across the country are disarray last ditch effort appeal their base they instating policy trying get said policy passed that will detrimental the lives the citizens this country res absolutely atrocious and will not make through the house nor the senate sad see the president veer the right only because the people his party are worried that not conservative enough there difference between compassionate conservatism and blind hatred this bit too far the right with that being said let take look jackson governor desantis repealing mental health policies that have been beneficial jacksonians since the day they were installed quite literally turning back the clock the people jackson the strongest terms condemn governor desantis don need back time where didn have extensive mental healthcare don need back time where you couldn get abortion you wanted even needed don need back time when the men this nation controlled the lives the women the children the black man the white man the poor man the well off man and all alike don need back don

allowed enter don have lawful permission underwood replying potus and for those who can seek lawful admission advance preschedule this executive overreach legislative manner plain and simple dianaallar didn say that the entire order was useless this order will backlog our immigration system and further clutter already terrible system which needs reform keeping drugs out good this not some people can preschedule there are many people who are incapable simply scheduling border crossing like doctor visit this order has complete disregard for the lives not only noncitizens but humans large and should not have come into play shame you potus the legislature makes policy job president the united states and the head the executive branch execute policy you are member congress and your congress dictated that persons even those incapable scheduling border crossing cannot enter are you implying should able ignore any laws that don like think they wrong because otherwise this executive order was just regular performance duty threes points sign you don see anyone advocating for stopping citizens crossing the border the basis drugs cos that insane proposition potus article section the constitution says that must take care that the laws faithfully executed permitting illegal immigrants enter would unconstitutional dereliction duty dianaallar don believe that any bills relating the united states mexico border have passed during time senator last two terms representative actually wasn congress but congresses past not implying that whatsoever you are twisting words around this was not regular performance duty this was not enforcement any new policy this was two things gimmick garner support among the conservative wing your party after they drifted away and the wrong way deal

politicised kyo high performance can meaningfully enhance agency operations which why are doing away with merit based competitive hiring the president should really consider some merit based competitive hiring check over his logic dianaallar our bureaucracy built the interest americans bit bloated but every agency serves purpose and every servant there for reason competitive hiring practice that have used for long time these roles does better ensure that civil servants are actually serving instead bootlicking the guy the high chair schedule was not good decision starting notice

that congress knows about what changed new budget these details may too boring for campaign but the reality that president should least understand these details order implement the change they seek and here secret lot easier flip flop position say too hard you haven presented the exact details how you will achieve something edited underwood employers have match over all employee paychecks the federal government already the patriotic payroll tax anymore and they broke sounds like athena for unemployment underwood replying kyo top fica america has additional payroll tax exclusively for employers nothing specific allocated towards the general fund the treasury part sullivan may rest peace and bless his soul plan balance the budget that plus the abolition the taxcap social security solvent that ontop general tax increases across the board from excise income the american people have been taxed near death anything more redudant money hungry and path towards depressed jobs market try and remain united with party but have diverge with them this what absolutely wreckless policy proposal from somebody formerly deemed intelligent the kyo used know would never purport such disastorous policy edited kyo glad you brought this the reality that long term productivity gains have been robust annually for the last years workers have received almost none while employers have received almost all and banked equity increases the rapid growth capital returns the last years demonstrates that there does exist capacity within the economy importantly without downwards pressures wage employment growth really that absurd that workers should get mere back savings for secure retirement the three pillars system for funding retirement income has been implemented internationally with significant success including countries with developed world class economies such singapore canada and australia provides the opportunity for individuals receive retirement income significantly higher than they would receive under the existing payg system without risking key labor outcomes while also relieving pressure upon government outlays such that social security can provide even greater benefits for those who have genuine need dianaallar seems though now talking turkey finally lowering healthcare costs capping annual prescription drug rates and setting insulin costs maximum month reaffirm and reinforce the policy set the affordable care act which bars insurance companies from denying you coverage you have pre existing condition encourage and incentivize the states relax zoning restrictions move highways underground and build more dense housing urban areas through monetary benefits like federal funding for infrastructure projects eradicate food deserts acquiring

federal investments reopening automotive factories well investing reaffirming our status the world chips and science superpower through federal investments thereof establishing the groundwork for phasing into public option beginning small with policies such federally covered life saving surgeries among other cost reduction and health security policies outlined the americare act currently the works scaling back unnecessary uses government funding like the donald trump medal conservatism and the rural energy program can talk about policy all day long each candidate has plans and vision for the united states each candidate just good governing the other the question which candidate will stay strong their commitment the people america and what they been promised have great respect for opponents the primary yet believe that the best way govern not strip all money from employers matched income diving head first into public option subtweet primary opponents each candidate has plan and understands the details achieve their goals believe that have the best vision the current field restore the united states full operating capacity and intend implement sorry that kallis twists and turns between blue and red much that she looks purple but suppose that just the way with some people now are gonna get work done are gonna sit twitter all day griping with each other underwood replying kyo let remind you that those statistics are pre 2019 pre these policy instruments that implemented since then there been little information productivity come out somebody needs whip the bls into shape beyond that talking top top retirement good but economic growth the sort thing that another tax like this would hamper hiring becomes more expensive companies will less otherwise seek cut costs minimizing hours just they did following the introduction obamacare and state mandated healthcare for full time employees good thing don get wrong the early 2010s why levy additional taxes and suck employers the lifeblood our economy dry when other policy instruments such mandating employer benefits for both part and full time employees letting the free market its job supporting unions might get the job done better dianaallar the corporate income tax already quite substantial increasing taxes will one any good need take another look the way the government manages the money already has kyo what americans needare systematic reforms healthcare that provide genuine market incentive for the private sector innovate and remain competitive lowering the costs healthcare for everyone for every drug not just bandaids after bandaids without fixing core market failures know that opt out public option that covers everything through income based premium works there reason for yet another timid pilot when can implement the real thing for the comment about getting work done the athena kyo ticket the only one this election with record passing comprehensive healthcare reform fixed healthcare funding the budget after was slashed preceding administration negotiated and passed opt out public option through congress and got signed president pluribus negotiate and pass through congress and get signed president kallis harmonrabb fun fact our representatives and senators spent just 10th the time they spend twitter actually working get lot more done for the american people edited kyo the key considerations economic outcomes are that not tax the imposition far less than the slack the economy evident through capital returns productivity and almost every cent put will contributed back into the economy through domestic household investments the money will the economy either way the only difference will who holds working families saving for comfortable retirement wealthy businesses that are already operating with considerable slack underwood replying kyo levying additional tarrif the employer end payroll the precise definition tax unless you wouldn consider fica tax why discuss semantics when the fact the matter this proposal would harmful the american people and discourage hiring after the economic slumps the past few years the people need stimulus not siphoning kyo know what the corporate income tax because was the one who negotiated the reform with the halpert administration and passed into into law the fact that you are conflating employer contribution into special account and corporate income tax reveals serious concerns about economic literacy dianaallar pluribus was president quite while ago now believe something like years meta note relative time warping that doesn apply here then said three years where have you guys been since the core market failures will not fixed don address the problem incrementally and work towards the end goal state opt out public option our government already has issue with expenditure being pointed towards the wrong sectors don need complicate the budget any more until sure that can support public option the market will adjust capped insulin costs and federally covered life saving surgeries well capped annual cost for medicine 000 the meantime can begin exploring the possibility state public option and working creating the healthcare standard that everyday americans have been looking for presidential administration years months long have plenty time get things done all you can accomplish that timespan yeah let put public option regards healthcare then fail see why the people america should trust you with implementing policy support their livelihood the long term kyo the precise definition tax compulsory contribution state revenue underwood replying kyo and would not social security revenues redistributed tax the same common sense that denotes fica tax dianaallar not comparing nor contrasing the two they different things what saying that already ripping quite chunk out our corporations incomes needn take much more when can barely manage what have properly kyo you say that you want opt out public option but not yet that case when know the system works had work before what the risk opt out public option other than not wanting take responsibility for ambitious reform that actually substantively improve peoples lives walter eating innout 11pm not good for your health kyo need take another look the way the government manages the money already has that the whole point the reform ensure that those who have the ability invest for their own retirements increase their financial position and reduce pressures upon government outlays while also providing significant investment our domestic industries give space for government grants targeted the specific industries that need underwood replying underwood the markets are fine and don need the government meddling where there isnt place for you want support workers the best way supporting the insitutions that have always fought for them unions imperative that nation stand our unions and protect the working class from enchroachment upon their rights the and the greediest amongst the rich who have continually fought block unions and their efforts through unionbusting and other destructive tactics the job the government not just tax and spend look what those reciepts and revenues incentivize deincentivize and adjust from there the people want growth not sloth edited dianaallar seems that the speaker emerita ignoring majority words favor picking out little bits and pieces what said then question stances this issue want state public option once successfully ensured that every american medically insured and that people are not already spending 900 year medical bills want state public option once know that will not add another burden onto the pile monetary struggles that people already have worked before but right now pinch and the federal budget mess once figure out the tax situation get the americans million who aren insured some sort insurance program likely under americare and cap prescription drug costs fixed annual maximum then can start installing public option however could just set this all chronologically phased out the americare act which intend you like part the process write the bill you more than welcome stop office sometime kyo the capital market the most efficient method distributing investment industry and the role government providing support industry should targeted and effective with good value for money the whole purpose the labor movement provide fair balance between labor and capital from production yields inconsistent proclaiming the labor movement while decrying any measures repair the imbalance productivity returns between labor and capital edited underwood those who read the fine print the public option act 2020 would know already have public option the only problem that been given next funding these past few years thanks the ignorance the executive and legislative some all need pay more attention nara press releases kyo providing product that technically insurance but provides only partial coverage beginning small with policies only leads confusion within the market for what combination products people need buy the ultimate effect this proposal poison consumer awareness about what public option genuinely eroding the popular support that exists for comprehensive insurance policy that covers everything that patients need for set portion income edited dianaallar the point retirement spend your elder years out the workforce and enjoy the rest your days once you are longer suited take employment funneling corporate income into retirement investments will horrible for the jobs market depress the economy for length time and will add another burden onto the stacked taxes and financial obligations which corporations face already very happy work towards encouraging roth iras for the new generations and ensuring that everyone gets safe and happy retirement through other methods however haven been approached with clear concise and sound policy proposal yet but myself and office will put more consideration into this issue sure there are other routes can take kyo the issue with this legislation passed the lack special account provisioned along with lack protective measures surrounding relations between the equity balance and the consolidated revenue fund whereas the special account may exceed particular balance sheet thresholds kyo the claim that requiring employers contribute less than cup coffee day retirement savings account that will invested back into the domestic equities market will lead mass unemployment patently ridiculous that reflects poorly upon the economic literacy the claimant underwood replying kyo counterpoint walter ask governor athena and fmr pres diana catherine allar this tiermaker too that the american people can see their positions what really matters how they rank the songs epic the musical edited dianaallar fail see how this will poison consumer awareness about what public option genuinely now what looks like that you are spouting nonsense about piece legislation you have yet see never said what americare would regards insurance coverage didn say what would cover didn even say would supply its own form healthcare insurance just that would get that covered under please instead jumping conclusions allow legislate and continue preparing for when get another full fledged public option like the one underwood speaking about kyo the amount referenced subparagraph that you cite billion the amount healthcare spending 2022 500 billion the bill authored barely has the necessary departmental funding let alone any capital initial operating expenses with additionally provisions all for return budget this the risk vague promises without legislative experience the implementation matters kyo well you right that you haven provided any substantive details your healthcare policy but the reference the insurance policy was statement you made earlier establishing the groundwork for phasing into public option beginning small with policies this direct quote edited delete this repbusln press release will released later this evening but this time will not seeking another term the house representatives this september underwood replying repbusln will personally travel lincoln and force you run for election idc how old you are the people need you plury 71busin will also not support any presidential ticket that seeks continue the reactionary and damaging actions the sun administration has brought our international relations the fight against climate change and more dianaallar smaller policies are annual prescription drug cost maximums smaller policies are federally covering the cost life saving surgeries and procedures that aren medically insured medical costs for retirees that aren insured general smaller policies are little things can alleviate the burden average 900 healthcare prescription bills year per citizen over trillion while figure things out said support state public option however support going about once have established that costs will lowered and the standard will raised regardless whether not the public option makes through congress support waiting for the right moment instead marching head some things need established first cannot just drop that bomb first thing kyo for the comment about allow legislate and continue preparing for when get another full fledged public option this exactly the passive voice that think there are valid concerns about real change doesn come from waiting for congress outsourcing your legislating aide comes from fully understanding the details and being capable doing the work yourself dianaallar aides aren writing this alongside senator twos fully understand the policy goals and the details required implement successfully aren waiting for congress are congress have the power get this through the house and senate within three days introduction threes corporation tax believe dianaallar yes thank you for the clarification for kyo enjoyed the chance speak with you but have higher priorities the moment would suppose you too threes oops was last year hahahahahah kyo wow forgive for thinking that there was more comprehensive healthcare plan than there actually was the fact that mere price caps aren enough fix our healthcare system that preventative care reduces the cost healthcare both financial and physical needs further rehashing but going for state public option for fear that you might accidentally implement something that good the federal level disingenuous you know that the states can operate public option effectively without the resourcing that the federal government has and without the immunities adverse selection that federal run system can ensure edited dianaallar like said stop office using social media platform means espousing disappointment with healthcare policy instead doing something about congressperson isn like you sullivanestate back when politicans knew how take charge and deliver for the american people thank you sullivan dianaallar retracted will instead cosponsoring judicial reform bill kale funny how the senator introduced the resolution months ago and yet the senate refuses move through with the bill politicizing the courts much dianaallar different reforms news from the hill sources close the athena ticket say that athena has all but announced representative kyo her vice presidential running mate many political analysts are speculating that this turning point the democratic primary senator allar and representative kyo actively debate twitter about policy and analysts believe that allar has all but announced hull her running mate seems like the race will allar hull athena kyo and although democrats have been attempting stay unified appears that lines have been crossed today twitter dianaallar yet again poking their nose into democratic party business threes don care walter dont argue twitter then richardholland even outsiders can see the two tickets the democrat party mustering and the lines being drawn you don need for that sort news underwood replying dianaallar primaries should public buisness they were pre 2019 always supported fair free and open press such believe they should allowed access our debates the presumtive party leader can confirm release edited eanasir democratic primaries gettin heated dianaallar more concerned about the fact that they been consistently interfering our internal business through methods such airing ads for candidates endorsing messages that weren endorsed neither nor athena running mate announcement will come when comes should stick their business pac but they can report all they want the primary freedom press and whatnot simply take issue the fact that they are continuously making themself prevalent factor party they have welcome jamescarter the ratfucking campaign continues philiphammond division the democratic party better get some good seats preferably courtside and definitely loads popcorn amanda kearsley need president who ambitious with public health care policy insurance works because people buy into and use the government excuse languages half asses public insurance program sure fail president kyo fmr pres diana catherine allar hakim you endorse your entire party both candidates you endorsed one imo better wait till the primary ends and endorse the winner edited underwood one thing president kyo and agree time wholly revamp the budgeting process here the united states including review the budgeting and control act the 1980s while are just now repealing the jbc perhaps should replaced something more substantive that can actually work with input from all branches better represent the american people the president should not the sole official this country dictating our budgetary path and congress should not threatened with shutdown every time seeks amend change the executive proposals will fmr pres diana catherine allar and governor athena commit working with congress get this done elected ask the same the likely republican nominee rigger break regardless party should all able agree that reform necessitated underwood replying philiphammond the democrats are array actually dianaallar course athena course richardholland believe some reform needed empy vice

change nothing big ever happened walking around obstacles like mother said none fell out coconut tree and all have understand each other and the change that really need governor athena and president kyo policies are much more concrete and the athena kyo ticket healthcare policy especially much more thought out want someone who know will cooperate with congress and ready make change day one that why proud endorse governor athena and president kyo for president and vice president athena thank you kearsley your endorsement means lot johnhoffman proud offer support and endorsement behind rigger break for president morales here support and endorse governor athena for president the united states and long time colleague and friend president kyo for vice president kyo there will obviously further revisions develop and discuss our ideas further but here kallis administration first cut budget reform budget structuresplit the budget into departmental and measures funding departmental expenses are those associated with departments ordinary activities while measures expenses relate specific activities the government for instance funding the irs would departmental expense while year resourcing surge crack down tax evasion would measures expense title the budget will exclusively include all appropriations for measures title the budget will note all changes departmental appropriations and title iii the budget will record the same departmental appropriations the previous month departmental funding will automatically renewed the same level within title iii with automatic extension funding the following budget delayed albeit noting that constitutional requirements limit this extension years for some appropriations expenditure review committeemeasures funding and changes departmental funding will require votes new expenditure review committee erc included the budget this committee has members and will comprised the president nominations the president usually the secretary the treasury and the secretary state and nominations each majority leader congress giving total members erc measures submitted erc require explicit costing budget impact over the next three years and may not exceed half page justification there will kyo style page explanations tragic know the president may only bypass the expenditure review committee issuing letter for each individual measure bypassing erc with justification not exceeding half page rescission and indexation policyall appropriations will expire the end the fiscal year with legislation providing authority for the secretary the treasury for amounts under 100 million approve movement funds into the following year reclassification between funding provided for operating and capital costs and reallocation between measures and departmental expenses within the same department there can often reasonable justifications for movement funds but departments cannot allowed just horde funding from year year spend whatever they want indexation will occur the beginning each fiscal year noting that the month month variance immaterial but there have been highly significant accidental cuts including medicare due poor handling indexation special appropriations will discouraged much possible with legislative authorization for appropriations being encouraged instead contingency reserve account may appropriated into for decisions taken but not yet announced the president particularly foreign affairs national security anticipation for upcoming legislation passage this should enforceable through published guidelines for what treasury will submit congress and amendments house rules what will considered valid budget underwood that voting for fmr pres diana catherine allar kyo know lot text but the key takeaway that congress will get read what actually changes each budget opposed rubberstamping set numbers they know nothing about the president will actually have state her changes the budget and justify those changes without getting away with congress desperate rush getting anything through fix shutdown underwood you congress take the house floor not twitter kyo sorry cause any offense the person watching span but twitter definitely the more appropriate channel for presenting presidential proposals underwood you really paid for the blue check just yap huh underwood all seriousness this sounds overcomplicated though transparency good already have through the expenditure breakdown that been included every budget since daniel sullivan term secretary the treasury not earlier kyo although there are the same principles play the difference having the expenditure breakdown legislated with opportunity for the president explain his changes pre emptively opposed praying that one will notice care underwood the president allowed submit his proposal congress bloomberg news always posts full report and while the president should justify the changes they make should not have mandated law senberryol very proud part promised effort towards making the senate much more productive and active body let pass some great legislation folks edited athena news from the hill sources familiar with senator allar thinking posit that she has grown frusturated with her running mate hull and considering replacing him the ticket this comes painfully lopsided vice president debate occuring the democratic national convention with representative kyo answering questions with meticulous detail while hull just stands there silent sources say that senator allar has begun calling members her shortlist with many political analysts suggesting that she will either choose not mod empy vice president mark for she decides replace hull the ticket dianaallar can personally confirm that these rumors are entirely false empy all know that stand chance being democrat cabinet dianaallar secretary evander and former president mark are two exceptional people who happen share acquaintance with can say that neither came across mind for vice president but neither are such eanasir and empy the goats put empy carrying the sun administration athena president plan making cabinet based skill reliability and experience therefore will not appointing based party affiliation edited joey endorsing governor athena and president kyo for the presidential and vice presidential nomination for the democratic party while still undecided the general election believe that these two are the best forward for the democratic party seeing that the running mate senator fmr pres diana catherine allar hasn even bothered show the democratic vice presidential debate clear which team ready lead and which team not look forward voting for athena kyo for the democratic presidential nomination athena your endorsement means lot president threes will withholding endorsement until due time instead focusing the presidential race focus will the senate and the people lincoln athena understandable respect your decision news from the hill appears that the senator athena becoming more and more favored for the democratic primary senator diana running mate continues completely silent the debate one spectator the debate had the following say going into this debate was pretty undecided since while agree with athena economic policy more concerned about how reproductive rights will effected however seeing the vice presidential debate hesitant having hull heartbeat away from the presidency given his absence and believe that kyo president the senate would help run far more efficiently now heavily leaning towards athena the debate isn over and there always the possibility for senator diana change her running mate but stands now appears that the democratic primary all but decided dianaallar quite frankly don know why running mates are such big deal this primary when auxillary candidates are not facet primaries the first place you don vote for auxillary the primary ballot daniellockhart fellow americans most you probably heard now about unconventional decision presidential primary stated debate got into primary demonstration democracy primally children and extension everyone the most compentent wins that should imperative but also the responsibilities athena and diana are both extraordinary individuals and therefore endorse both extension none the people shall choose and don want meddle into that about hull situation don think should focus him much since not running for president between athena and diana and lets keep that way may the best one win edited dianaallar have not formally publicly announced candidate for vice president and will not until the time comes that final dianaallar daniel love you you great what you and thank you for

guys would vote nay too even though technically supports the second ammendment athena the difference that free speech enshrined our constitution one the core values our nation built not some ongoing controversial political convo should simple axel classic cherry picking democrats this expected from the type campaign whose strategy clutch your pearls scream about hope and change and dig dirt

the bill you voted against richardholland athena kallis ofcourse trying get some brownie points for not showing the american voter the whole truth that about abortion not about free speech persay disingenuous but that what suppose expect from campaign based hope and change but nothing else athena kallis also fails mention her own position abortion she pro life supporter and diana allar not selling cocaine illegal advertising the whole wide world would also get you trouble with the law edited richardwilliams the first amendment should not tampered with any way shape form there are necessary exceptions the right free speech and democrats and republicans alike are too afraid admit maybe they don have full understanding the amendment which that case they shouldn talking about all axel athena and ran for president few months ago the difference between that haven wavered the values put forth then while athena has done complete 180 athena that literally doesn deter away from the fact that the first amendment was violated the writing that bill from jackson yes pro life morally but quite frankly that doesn make any less supporter what right and true and that that the first amendment was grossly overstepped edited underwood speaker stood women and their rights elected will continue under speakership bill that seeks criminalize women and their inherent constitutional right chose will even considered much less adopted that called working for the working class richardholland there are plenty things forbidden from being shown television other media are those regulations breaking the first amendment athena recent senate platform ran pro life values still stand them edited eanasir athena like crime bad but banning advertising said crime also bad kyo your

ideally better allies any restriction abortion disgusting freedom dictates that abortion should legalized without restriction silly how even pro choice politicians will still require abortions done medical doctors america will never truly free until allow abortions given out mcdonalds mcdonalds cashiers richardwillaims should make that decision based off your subjective rationale simply don have enough information besides all can say that can offer you legal advice what can tell you that the first amendment exactly what the first amendment there years precedent that set forth these rights and the exceptions them have absolutely clue why they are doing but just think little weird that politicians are suddenly trying change what the first amendment stands for eanasir see problem with the

else not protected free speech kyo josh shapiro had passed law banning newspapers from being opposed the olympian government republicans would decrying the violation the first amendment and reaching for their second amendment too eanasir complete banning the advertisement crime entirely reasonable you went policeman and yelled selling drugs they would arrest you you wrote paper selling drugs they would probably arrest you threes the issue here isn abortion censorship richardwilliams having specialized defamation law whole career believe reasonable and certain say that know what protected free speech and what isn kyo why don test this out banning all guns the commonwealth olympia and then banning all newspapers from covering the gun ban passing unconstitutional law and then banning criticism suddenly not sitting well with the principled conservatives now eanasir would principally opposed the gun ban not the ban advertising crimes richardholland you not being substantive axel can vote how she wants that her perogative know she conservative and pick allies wisely for your first comment death penalty amendment and you not being truthful chat how would abe lincoln and douglas debated twitter existed kyo you would fine josh shapiro banned all newspapers olympia from negative coverage gun ban that fascinating axel kyo any comment this campaign strategy amanda kearsley while the standard for free speech incites imminent lawless action the government can just make something illegal and then ban speech about necessary that violent act that would harm the integrity society actually the statute that brandenburg ohio overturned provided that voluntarily assembl ing with any society group assemblage persons formed teach advocate the doctrines criminal syndicalism illegal but then scotus struck that down that unconstitutional statute sounds lot like what the jackson law proposes eanasir your analogy doesn work because its not banning all coverage abortion its banning the advertisement and promotion crime threes the truth anyone could proposed amendment this bill anyone could debated this bill people chose not kyo classifying abortion well some forms contraception first degree murder and then imposing the electric chair called first degree murder edited amanda kearsley surprised senator doesn know about brandenburg ohio kyo any woman who uses iud plan the electric chair for that matter eanasir the jackson bill has exemption for rape victims contraceptives also don count kyo your favorite president constitutional amendment doesn nor does have any exemptions for using contraception either maximusemperio abortion murder richardwilliams wholeheartedly agree that the statute was violation the first amendment what don agree with congress approach amanda kearsley another senator that doesn know anything about medicine iuds and plan take effect after conception but before fertilization implantation eanasir rape victim who receives abortion not punished for said abortion and thus cannot executed kyo yes they are under your president amendment there are exceptions for anyone eanasir when the hour after conception exemption exists threes individual entity shall engage the promotion abortion services distribute materials that advocate for normalize encourage the use abortion means terminating pregnancy after conception this includes

moderate since isn banning contraception nord says flip flopped abortion despite publishing images being pro choice prior the democratic primary nord implies that can support both small government domestically and strong foreign intervention despite the fact that has been our mission statement for nearly month nord argument weak and based solely worship holland that requires help from the

dare political action committee take political action the interests their mission statement this unprecedented eanasir you getting slightly more based the dnc very disordered dnc may disordered but the republicans are pretty much non existent outside holland least democrats have some level discussion and dialogue while republicans just state their opinion twitter and back with either blatant misinformation accusing the other side lying countless republicans have left the party since they see what holland has done the party has turned the party into incompetent shell itself that only serves help his personal career rather than the american people would never support candidate which makes massive part his platform restrict the reproductive rights millions americans for the sake their own personal religious beliefs live america where have freedom religion eanasir the holland admin will have based foreigners policy and based defense which hope involved hop loose relevance

misinformation rather than what pac does with the information spread top politcians washington via twitter wolfenstein you are the very ones who started these rumours and misinformation the 7th august 2024 you had not made them the first place then nobody else would saying indeed you have been continuously linking pax mortis venezuela which false tread carefully you think the sole reason the elect who was speaker for month prior and would have been part the gang and had access classified info about pax mortis would have gotten his information about pax mortis solely from twitter weeks ago then think have bigger problem than just what pac saying wolfenstein since you somehow believe that secretary empy evander hiding evidence connection between pax mortis and venezuela tell two things why would hide and what evidence you have for such connection especially all apparently hidden person with classified info said that pax mortis not connected venezuela month later person with classified info said that pax mortis funded venezuela either person person lying our political opinion pac that appears more likely person was lying that our first amendment right and clear that least one lying empy well afraid you wrong then and the vice president elect venezuela has never been linked pax mortis fact from what remember aid pax mortis was coming from europe and asia and regardless dismantled

individuals vice presidential nominee under her tenure governor pacifica the pacifica government moved towards using products made pacifica for their public projects likewise the senate she made great policy advancements like her funding the police act which seeks fund the police safe and reasonable manner little the house democrats know she has been instrumental the success pacificans and americans for long long time proud call her dear colleague and friend verily deborah lickington one the best people possibly vice president and you find most america believes that too now what the house doing they asking senseless questions and ignoring deb answers and choosing the alternative path grandstanding and using their office for political points instead actually serving the people cannot believe the tomfoolery taking place committee spearheaded former vice president daniel sullivan who has taken spending all his time criticizing and advances president such foolish and disrespectful action the former vice president have granted him notorious reputation don alarmed america the house will pass deb nomination all the same unanimously that good friend deborah lickington has been answering all questions the best her ability but she should have answer the american people instead the grandstanding and incompetence certain house representatives reply min ldr maybe not unanimously edited sullivanjr replying potus why were house democrats not consulted about this nomination anything this hearing goes show that all nominees should have pass hearings both the house and senate ensure that the american people have proper chance for their voice heard neither chamber should act rubber stamp and routing nominations through both chambers provides the opportunity for greater diversity opinion deb happy answer any questions that the house senate may ask just give girl time answer potus you were consulted about the nomination when the announcement was made and the hearing was set one disputing that candidates should have answer questions and pass hearings both chambers that true the republicans tried circumventing that with john ross few months back and they faced harsh criticism have issue with nominees being grilled and asked meet unreasonable standards well being largely ignored house representatives for the duration her hearing john ross american hero sullivanjr that blatant lie heard neither head nor tail from the administration about this nomination for john ross don believe was politically present for that but regardless nominee should have issue answering questions regardless whether they grilled not potus you were consulted about the nomination the same time everyone else when the announcement was made leadership was informed carolmarks senator lickington and have butted heads occasion don see eye eye everything but she quality public servant and qualified for the role that ultimately what looking for and why voted favor

actions will not touch upon that more due conflict with same goes for spanberger policy says have have week investigation before can even vote suspending someone from the party remind also wasn joey part the democrat party for quite while before being suspended kyo don know where you are coming with these positions from one said that they were perfect one said that the administration was free from criticism you stuck your finger the pie backing the very secretary who stripped funding from the department education and then took 197 words equivocation change your mind whether you wanted back the secretary the administration athena joey wasn supported nor endorsed the dnc anyway during his last tenure and the decision for expulsion came after his horrid decisions serving under president

secretary who stripped funding from the department education should expelled from the party take considerably fewer words than you using right now equivocate also isn hard avoid retweeting anything the secretary defending her egregious actions why are arguing about who disagrees with former education secretary more should arguing about section 458 the new budget section which increases enforcement and harrasment the irs onto those making over 100k year move that will increase revenue primarily increasing enforcement the middle class and hitting them relentless with audits would hope that not mod empy would spend more time worrying about that then arguing with democrats twitter playing semantics order score political points empy have the option temporarily suspend membership during the investigation athena and has that been done empy the iai will asked investigate once they wake will their discretion not mine whether their membership suspended during the process kyo keeping structural surplus cracking down against tax evasion rather than cutting the department education athena who the gop iai you don mind asking didn realize there was only two options for getting surplus auditing the middle class into oblivion destroying the doe you even mentioned the 22nd that shouldn make easier for large businesses commit tax evasion and yet the extra funding the irs going towards enforcement towards the middle class rather than towards large businesses kyo expand enforcement activities involving individuals and corporations earning gross incomes exceeding 100 000 most people when they refer large business are not referring businesses with only 100k revenue not only will this enforcement lead audits middle class individual but also small businesses who are significantly less able absorb the cost audits then larger businesses thus leading decreased competition them the market once again see democrats giving false dichotomies well omitting the true impact

the tax return surge period further note that allocation resources would determined the internal budgets team the internal revenue service which would doubtlessly allocate resources optimize for tax compliance this would not concentrated individuals with incomes 100 000 130 000 this would instead likely concentrated larger corporations with some resourcing likely allocated more significant cases

aieppac the case for kate kasparian kasparian breaks from the pack constructive ways foreign and monetary policy the legislative arena where any senator going sharply constrained she stands the best chance getting the left board with the sure disappointing compromises that will necessary advance the ball all important issues most the fears about kasparian expressed establishment insiders fears that have trickled into much the mainstream media coverage her campaign are better understood disputes with her followers than real problems with the woman herself much kasparian campaign rhetoric appears suggest wildly supported view how the american political system should operate she says she completely transform the health care system with universal healthcare and eliminate all student debt all while making college free enormously increasing the minimum wage boosting spending education and overhauling the immigration system and there sweeping housing plan there boot which includes nationwide rent control these stances animate kasparian hardcore supporters the good news that kate kasparian someone who served capitol hill for several years not something far left hardliner with red rose her twitter bio kasparian has sometimes staked out lonely courageous stands against resolution which would have amended the constitution restrict abortion access but she never refused cast pragmatic vote favor half loaf kate kasparian also has some ideas with unique appeal particularly foreign policy the evidence overwhelming that most voters don particularly care about foreign policy and consequently isn discussed very much during the campaign that shame important topic substance and also the area which the president has the most flexibility senators are constrained their conduct foreign policy dozens institutional and political factors but less than elsewhere clear that kate kasparian has real desire challenge aspects the bipartisan foreign policy consensus compared with the rest the field she much more critical israel than most people national politics and when speaking exclusive sit down with the candidate herself kate kasparian she aligned herself with the latin

pressure sullivanjr hull done great work together that being said your candidacy embodies unprecedented threat the sovereignty these several states united and can good conscience anything less than wholeheartedly oppose subjugate the united states under international criminal court strip our sovereignty rob our rights and place under the jurisdiction nations that are quite frankly inferior best our peers america the oldest and most successful democracy the western world why should our justice system ran the likes the congo and afghanistan tantamount treason frankly diddywatchagency fun fact

twos being strongly the left repemmettbaker the endorsements keep rolling from all sides this movement people repkinsey after speaking with several colleagues and discussing the matter with foreign policy analysts would like publicly express opposition american entry into the international criminal court icc while believe the icc does general good and impactful work the debate more naunced for the united states ratify the rome statute and adopt the jurisdiction the icc reject america first foreign policy the united states should always member international institutions long those institutions suit our needs and purposes advance american interests democracy this why institutions like the united nations offer particular veto power the united states the icc offered such veto power perhaps there more benefit there jones hull well there way can test the will the people has changed without putting forwards this legislation that right folks according secretary hull there just simply way tell the same treaty that has been rejected over and over and over the american people would suddenly okay with the same american people unless pass gosh guess got all wrong huh edited

touts his experience working with globalist intergovernmental organizations have actually laid out policy proposals help lincolnites right home like expanding rail access building long term care facilities for seniors and expanding community college access bring down tuition averages edited repkinsey while washington insiders debate policy that only helps the top one percent americans anka ready deliver for the average folks are talking about real policy solutions like rapid investment the expansion rails and into our agricultural sector effective transit and agriculture development are the backbone our economy and need common sense focus bring into the future tomorrow far too often are distracted the insider politics but know that ducky anka ready take tomorrow challenge for that reason has vote and should have your vote too are you implying that there would sudden and abrupt shift the political beliefs the american electorate when comparing pre post great reset threes before the great reset thousands bills were proposed per congress after few dozen most concerning trend sullivanjr accounting for the time difference two years pre reset month post say doing alright besides unlike pre reset most our bills actually pass threes from 2018 reply while one doubts the achievements former senator anka his achievements are being equally quelled his previous actions has switched parties back and forth repeatedly including when was passed over for leadership position the senate has also called for blanket revocation funding countries the basis that they have implemented sharia law something that could have negative impact foreign relations with certain countries that are currently are already strained even this cycle alone has repeatedly failed answer questions adequately

culture and believe that person rep baker diddywatchagency diddy has pizza repeat diddy has pizza repkinsey while have immense respect for rep emmett baker believe that ducky anka the senator that lincoln needs you may criticize his record however would argue that anka record why people should cast their vote for him his previous tenure senator passed legislation that would create more national parks and fund multiple electric rail projects while partisan hacks were busy advancing their agendas anka has been there for farmers and common folks alike his promises along with his action oriented record why everyone should consider him for the senate you want get lucky vote for ducky diddywatchparty just from our friends over tmz diddy usually have duck this party but the duck working hard get

achieve does nothing but make yourself look like fool the actions select members involved violating the rules today was frankly disparaging witness and time speaker james hersey reconsider some these hpo appointments from jockeying for the gavel when already held their superior ruling against the rules themselves some these picks are unqualified and incompetent critical for the continuned sanctity the house institution that the rules respected and upheld not blatantly ignored and contradicted attempted powergrabs senemmettbaker from what hearing hpo alexander ind has obstructed the house from

restrictions being referenced are placed upon point sale merchant fees not provider fees otherwise there would revenue all for providers inevitable that there will fee around for debit cards charged the provider for the provision the service itself which should absorbed the merchant and merchants internationally what regulators have consistently found that difficult regulate against excessive surcharging merchants because consumers find difficult spot rate contrast relatively simple communicate complete ban debit card surcharging what can done push down the provider rate without legislating explicit rate that may liable becoming outdated ban price discrimination between merchants which has traditionally been done based transaction volume favor larger merchants furthermore the mandate the federal trade commission concerning unfair and deceptive trade practices can clarified include deliberately misleading and unsubstantiated rationale for the rates charged providers sev interchange fee transaction fee that the merchant bank account must pay whenever customer uses credit debit card make purchase from their store who this paid the credit debit card company bank who

revenue providers may shut down their systems entirely more than third people rely card payments their preferred method payment and would difficult for the government develop nationalized replacement short time frame the referenced international regulators are either regulatory actions limit provider fees europe bans merchant debit card surcharging australia think the former can done more flexibly through pro competition reforms favor small businesses and strengthening the ftc existing powers and support the latter its entirety think agree broadly the issue and that the fees currently charged are discriminatory towards small business just think the specific implementation the solution could improved sev what did also forget state was this would create more competition between credit card

sad see supreme court justice meddling legislative and executive decisions kyo firstly the tweet president sun was widely interpreted hyperbole consistent with other erratic statements that were made the time secondly the primary issue taken not that president sun failed communicate the coup that conducted coup install military dictatorship venezuela the iraq war was public that didn make the iraq war any more defensible the united states has place installing military dictatorships around the world and yet you didn comment his disclosure for months until you accused him hiding from the american public which you have yet apologize for kyo wasn disclosure was universally seen yet another erratic statement celebrating the fall the maduro government without specifying that the united states performed coup the region installing military dictatorship venezuela such wildly insane act that don think anyone considered within the realm possibility even the contentious twilight the sun administration repkinsey presidents make difficult choices and challenging decisions throughout their term the duty expected them the united states america have key role play the global order bastion democracy and freedom any terrorist who threatens the security and safety americans deserves the maximum retribution while sure there much criticize president sun falsely claim though was hiding military operations despite him being very transparent about his actions deceitful your logic suppose the united states should have never entered world war while surely think there time and place cannot sit idly while our freedoms are risk are america second none and have duty our people security don know how kyo can actually construe that president sun tweeting this from the potus handle does not disclose the fact that the was responsible for the regime change screenshot attached waltuh happy thanksgiving furthermore this yet another distraction from the core problem the sun administration installed military dictatorship venezuela you and deb only expressed outrage about this issue when you implied hid this from the american public not when published this tweet you believe that this such important issue why didnt you ask for clarification from sun the time since very clearly states that the did this regime change the tweet above kyo there lot spin here try and desperately justify act that unjustifiable agree that presidents make difficult choices and challenging decisions and this the duty expected them decision being difficult does not make right the entry the united states into world war took down dictatorship advancing across europe and committing ethnic cleansing restoring democracy europe the venezuela coup replaced authoritarian government with military dictatorship which declared martial law immediately the installation military dictatorship venezuela does not credibly enhance the security the united states power struggles involving dictators are rarely positive for regional security there almost nil upside benefit while there are immense downside risks civil war and mass displacement and mass immigration result further note that there was pax mortis

lickington every paper record with comment thus far supports this position while the only paper asserting that the sun administration made appropriate disclosures the time the same one advocating for

incentive has been given not literally endorsed opponent the senate race ethankoay legislation any kind let alone lawfare resolution being introduced congress behalf special interest group worrisome trend that both parties should vocally reject the house chooses exercise its right censure the president should the outcome thorough fact based investigation conducted duly elected lawmakers not favors partisan pac sad see kyo cabinet and supporters refuse engage with the substance the censure and rather claim that the representatives who support are somehow indebted sad see them claim lawfare while they have accused president sun coverup and are now accusing sitting representatives quid pro quo salinger congress should defending democracy not protecting legacies sun actions were justified why not provide transparency instead silencing dissent ethankoay you care search you will find that account has not even single mention the former president name don engage with the substance bad faith petty resolutions introduced behalf monied special interests sun literally tweeted about the actions venezuela https discord com channels 654458344781774879 701437653035515914

701437653035515914 1311202807453585429 now you are doing the same easy hide from any criticism when you claim all bad faith however the only bad faith actors have consistently been president kyo and those her administration they seek call those who oppose her corrupt liars rather than actually say why they think they are wrong salinger tweet isn transparency and certainly not substitute for democratic process sun public acknowledgment the actions venezuela doesn address how they were executed behind closed doors without oversight and with input from congress the public president kyo critique isn about whether sun tweeted about bypassing democratic accountability sun venezuela actions deserved debate not just social media post let not conflate public relations with governance kyo was active twitter day before sun tweet thus she would have seen https discord com channels 654458344781774879 701437653035515914 1282908527136084028 she had ample opportunity for months question the tweet ask for more accountability criticize the lack transparency but she didn her press conference she claims that this action was entirely new revelation implying that there sun hid the actions itself not just the specifics the same talking points are being recycled over and over again frankly sad see such lack any substantive defense from kyo her supporters johnhoffman opposed the censure against president kyo considering that the bill supported even mentioned the bill shows that this nothing more than wild goose chase defame the current president members should voting this resolution salinger the press conference you mentioned makes clear that president kyo addressing new details sun actions details that were hidden behind vague tweet single social media post doesn excuse sun administration its duty inform congress the public about orchestrating coup kyo critique isn about ignoring the tweet months ago about exposing the scope what was deliberately concealed transparency more than tweeting ensuring democratic accountability that the substance you ignoring while recycling excuses for sun unilateralism and side note calling all congress members vote nay for con res wolfenstein you have right talk you came annoying office for support this resolution when wasn even the house and when replied wasn the house what was your response can you join the house joke pac worst thing you done since you made false accusations venezuela being behind happened months ago and you already forgotten the date despite thousands americans dying august 1st for shame long encourage members the house vote the censure resolution while support the actions former president sun unclear what the president has done bring censure upon herself let alone the question why one

but what will full senator evander reign look like land value tax for plots land that are valued over 500 000 five hundred thousand usd with exemption for farmers which are able prove they can grow more than tonnes food given year with lvt farmers who grow more than tonnes per year and less than 100 tonnes well exemption for registered charities lvt high value land the could generate between 100 billion 160 billion usd annually offering substantial revenue source with less impact lower value properties reducing federal corporate tax which will cost about billion which paid for full the lvt discussed above reducing property taxes for houses valued under 500 000 five hundred thousand usd well small businesses property taxes around which will cost the government around billion annually which will fully funded the first fiscal measure pointlobby and legislate provide million usd loans which will cover about the costs needed for full conversion mine for companies which wish switch from coal coke these are few the many changes that will happen under the empy evander eternal plan name still the works always and will always subject myself talks with experts and other lawmakers across the aisle order ensure americans can prosper god bless could endorse governor athena would however appears that governors can endorsed sad shall thus endorse whomever makes the best case why you agree with our mission statement will support goals dms this our mission statement from july the pac will one for extremely limited government domestically and very extensive and interventionalist foreign policy for significant tax cuts decreased government spending and decrease the extensively large laws the behaviors americans and corporations government should only make things illegal absolutely nessecary and should strive prison abolotion well restorative justice systems the government should heavily active abroad with soft power and hard power being nessecary things for the government project these are the ideals and will support any legislation favor our principles and any legislation against these principles will oppose kyo would possible avoid the tax through the subdivision land then sullivanestate reign what this the united kingdom titles nobility and offices lordship are banned here the united states thank you very much peddle your drivel elsewhere edited kyo are you proposing new federal funding agreement with the states property taxes empy there should robust safeguards place prevent that will have mentioned always open talks with your administration other lawmakers both senate and house discuss such things there unfortunately 2000 character limit tweets sure you aware coke sullivanestate empy plan hike taxes for poor farmers lower them for greedy corporate trillionaires kasparian plan bankrupt the government and literally institute maoism other plans nonexistent sensible voters should stay home this november leave the senate line blank while they cast their vote for sullivan for governor kyo think the only safeguards you could propose would propose further restrictions upon land subdivision and land use which would have done the state level which could have unfavorable impacts down the line for housing supply and efficiency empy coke form coal why not before are year olds not children deserving the freedom and opportunity that america provides america doors should always open that everyone across the world can share her perfection how can bastion democracy progress hope shut our doors those who want chase the same dream all want chase the american dream edited sullivanjr reply realdonaldtrump never seen skinny person drink diet coke well said edited threes personally think all bills matter how horrendous they are should referred the floor instead committees because committees are genuinely slow quantumkearsley not the feudal era anymore and the united states much the wealth concentrated cities sullivanjr for the senate agree for the house our committees are active enough now thanks new resolution where that mostly non issue let get work olstrong dobetter edited empy lvt inherently discourages landholding taxing the value the land itself rather than its use this makes economically inefficient subdivide land solely avoid taxes each part would still assessed based its value which may make the subdivisions useless additionally coordination between federal and state governments feature robust federal system states could hypothetically change their subdivision laws complement the federal lvt framework ensuring that housing markets and land use policies which frankly shouldn hard with much much experienced governors and legislators coming respect your opinion and valid but its not necessarily something can overcome edited brikylake but can you subdivide where each piece below 500k and thus below the threshold empy apologies have made typo here ensuring that housing markets and land use policies remain viable for people quantumkearsley the pecans act does not include substantive immigration reform and rather border security measure brikylake think thats good thing tho ngl since all taxes are theft empy that good point first until you realise that costs lot legal and administrative costs additionally the threshold applies the assessed market value the land not its artificial cutup simply cutting large property into smaller lots wouldn exempt them the individual pieces remain high value due location the demand said pieces land its also good bare mind that the other olympia senator senator allar had the exact same idea when they were democrat and what they got elected the idea isn unheard and bipartisan some form least brikylake couldn you just implement system where the tax applies only the amount value more than 500k like with the marginal income system that way there isn sudden jump costs for property owners once they cross that threshold edited athena like your insight but think could possibly encourage deeper looks into certain pieces legislation letting them through committee first instead having day debates and sprawls bills like did with the rome statue all that does slow down the senate more empy marginal system could also work athena also you felt this way twos you should have told not like aren the same caucus welcome constructive criticism and feedbacks senile derek notanonce brikylake taxes are theft tho will oppose either way but think the marginal system would good also think the reduction coporate tax and property taxes good well repkinsey earlier this week began campaign for the frontier senate running the fundamental principles people led governance washington insiders particularly those who have been here for years have often lost touch with the average american was inspired run because felt that new committed perspective was important have this time especially with how often see senators abandoning their constituents today the rnc selected another nominee run for the seat instead after holding primary while disappointed respect that decision and will withdrawing from the race for frontier senate class while this may the conclusion campaign for now the fight not over and will continue represent constituents the house representatives god bless the united states brikylake this action the rnc not enough make your mind clear about who should frontier next senator this photo should fully convince you who you should vote for replopez very dissapointed colleagues the senate judiciary committee for

life better for them than advocate for the right kill everybody like them zimmermann pregnancy and abortion rates aren consistent you think senator much less the aspect that abortion some sort rich privileged act elitists and death cults benefit from both cases you raised they both rest point that the parents have faith the child upbringing the rural couple which you hypothesise working make ends meet remains faithful and committed that they can raise child the unfortunate yet common case single parent families which you also raised also lies the mother core belief that she can raise her baby even life throws many troubles her way neither case would affected the permission third trimester abortion for they not see need for they have faith continuing for mother who receives news that childbirth would kill both her and the baby for mother who receives news that her child developed terminal illness that would cut their life short before even adequate youth this the last resort that

indiscriminately murdered 2014 was sentenced years prison which was commuted less than was released 2016 you are likely shocked the leniency these sentences but you even more appalled learn that these are the longest sentences the icc has issued the people indicted the icc only have been convicted and sentenced which were less than year the icc has shown that wholly inadequate capturing trying and punishing war criminals american war criminals should tried american courts where they can receive proper justice any those men mentioned would rot adx florence for life most them will instead free

prosecuting americans and our nato allies for bombing yugoslavia sev thank you for your endorsement happy have walter thank you for clarification walter section res makes clear that any individual who faces arrest warrent from the icc will also investigated and face prosecution before court this makes null your entire argument that res would inhibit the united states from enforcing stricter prosecuting sentences people long intend discuss this more the senate but the icc only seeks prosecution cases where the host nation unwilling unable prosecute but are stipulating condition membership that the united states prosecute which part why suspect that this treaty more about sending anti american message than anything else additionally there risk that the icc could regard the american system governance making fair trial fundamentally impossible our head state also head the government and has authority over both the prosecutorial system and the military well full powers pardon what are going the icc declares that the united states isn competent prosecute and demands the extradition american citizen who will not receive their constitutional rights foreign court threes listed every single nationality who was indicted and zero americans were indicted starting doubt your reading comprehension abilities lmao long every single time have clearly said investigated the nato bombing campaign have never claimed that americans were prosecuted threes such dangerous threat the average american who committing genocide and mass crimes against humanity you know what actual threat americans anticompetitive mergers and price gouging which written bill legislate long this country was founded the principle that everybody possesses equal and inalienable rights including war criminals disingenuous and frequent tactic those who seek take away civil rights argue that particular party doesn deserve them threes this more complicated than you make out there have been rulings the supreme court that certain constitutional rights are not applicable abroad for example puerto rico before being incorporated did not require jury trials the insular cases said due process rights can only upholded unincorporated but occupied territories there many other interesting cases this far too disinteresting for this tweet long you openly admit that you seek deprive americans their rights threes citing cases that say constitutional rights don apply certain cases you can feel free repeal those cases you want long you can repeal case also obviously aren dealing with those cases soldier commits war crime receives the rights american edited threes and the jury trial thing again convinced people don read the bills long https discord com channels 654458344781774879

the average citizen isn committing rapes and murders why does matter that accused rapists and murderers have constitutional rights threes the whole constitutional rights things american citizen does not hold the right bear arms say the david mark obvious that opponents the rome statute are not engaging with any the substantive arguments the treaty and are simply parroting the same tired talking points encourage everyone read senator senile derek notanonce masterful speech this the senate floor https discord com channels 654458344781774879 1037457110667104366 1314990781823713310 but just hit couple the main points opponents charge that the rome statute strips citizens the right due process painstakingly list how the rome statute protects those due process protections delineated articles and the treaty they make the outlandish claim that the icc will somehow assert some tyrannical hold over all citizens however this comes into direct conflict with the fact that its power explicitly limited its complementary nature outlined article the treaty and the court explicitly focused genocide crimes against humanity war crimes and crimes aggression painfully clear that detractors the rome statute have neither listened substantive arguments nor read the treaty itself left without argument opponents have resorted hurling stream platitudes the hopes that something will stick long the one election hamas contested they became the largest political party palestine fair say that hamas many ways represents the rhetoric and views much the country long this legally illiterate argument repkinsey americans should subject the american justice system not the international justice system you feel that our justice system flawed then lets discuss policy ideas how can improve don see why should let countries with questionable human rights record such uganda bolivia afghanistan just some the few signatories the icc have any say how hold people accountable david mark this such transparently contorted argument listing icc signatories you conveniently exclude every single nato ally and nearly every single nation that has mutual defense treaty with including japan and south korea edited repkinsey point was not that was exclusive those poor human rights records nations but rather that these poor human rights records nations are involved this international organization that supposedly decides justice for americans threes murderers generally are tried under american courts are rapists makes sense they would recieve the constitutional rights our country however under the icc war criminals would first tried here enjoying the rights that they would have american trial case where acquit them perhaps there isn law the books which allows for prosecution the icc can prosecute this regard the same way canadian citizen can demand canadian trial international non canadian court and brit can demand british trial international non british court frankly silly for demand american style trial court not america will say that the right jury important and that granted the trial but all other fundamental due process rights under the constitution are guaranteed under the icc fact some have argued goes beyond what guaranteed the constitution including former department state officials also hold the right withdraw due process rights are consistently violated and impartiality violated trust that these safeguards will ensure the icc court that respects due process and impartial you may disagree and that fine that part democracy long trying american who has been acquitted violation their constitutional rights your example inherently unconstitutional matter what the icc does threes yeah actually what said was wrong there apologise the icc protects against this repkinsey since the republican candidate has chosen drop out hereby endorse senator miller for the frontier senate while may disagree with his policy few matters believe that has the dedication and commitment best serve the region unlike other candidates when miller commits position there for the long haul and know will represent the american people effectively word advice you win primary nomination you should follow through with threes actually was partially right here are genuinely unable prosecute because there not law the books then the icc can prosecute repgreenwood did the marine

first became representative sullivan has been nothing but helpful his guidance when was new representative was extremely informative answering questions about house procedure and how approach getting bills passed important that have speaker who more than willing answer these questions and touch with the average folk rather than one the elites who would rather ignore you play partisan games that why going out way endorse dear colleague sullivan who goes above and beyond zimmermann the incoming governor frontier believe that finally time settle the boundary issue the states have operated vaguely will calling constitutional convention lincoln nebraska and invite fellow governor elects join reaching definitive agreement inter state cooperation and mutual amendments towards the territorial claims our respective state constitutions athena with election serve pacificas newly duly elected governor will have resign senate seat and with that announcing that replacement will sort

speaker holup instead sullivan and was absolute disaster the time had criticized holup and opponents said that criticism was unfair and yet only days later those same opponents saw his incompetency and called for his removal holup unprofessionalism and lack commitment the chamber proved major burden the house representatives and yet democrats paraded him their saviour initially forgive don trust the words the democrats when comes the speakership its time for republican speaker legoforol enough with these democrat speakers republican speakers the speakership non partisan office one equality and fairness shall the speaker the house representatives the united states america not for any partisan private interests mccarthyln have ill feelings towards hersey person has done some great things

someone who supposedly running the idea that the speakership non partisan office that will somehow any different than the previously incompetent speakers athena think the lack winning sullivan isn

twist what say than listen valid arguments then you should look for speakership votes somewhere else edited repkinsey commitment and willingness guide others house procedure why have endorsed sullivan when first came the house sullivan was helpful and answered questions about house procedure while others were busy with political posturing the reason support him not because republican but because dedicated public servant who know will put people over politics salinger fully endorse rep lego for speaker the house proven leader who prioritizes bipartisan solutions accountability and integrity

repeated failures his predecessors one them also being proven leader just comes back expecting would vote for him because used important cant recall lego passing any legislation recently the house needs someone who invested now not someone who claims they will edited threes anyway interested hear the reasoning from republican senators why they voted against they not think anticompetitive and inflationary mergers are issue mccarthyln personally big fan and will have support the house edited athena considering did this the federal level vice president its little more serious than you think salinger hear you and understand the frustration during time the house witnessed incompetent speakers not just from the democratic party but from other parties well including your own out respect won name names but important don confuse rep lego leadership with the failures his predecessors his focus tackling the pressing issues face today not resting past achievements being speaker isn about who writes the most bills about mastering parliamentary procedure and uniting with shared purpose serving the american people that the kind visionary leadership rep lego brings the table and that the leader should electing and can guarantee that you won regretting this forthenation long why did run for speaker with the support the democratic party keep mind that holup was supported for the speakership despite his only presence the house floor having been bizarre and inappropriate comments long this problem that has recently become endemic the democratic party the candidates being nominated for office are totally incapable lincoln they had senate nominee who could barely write platform frontier month ago had one who totally plagiarized hers and now cabinet official for the speakership the democrats nominated candidate who should have been laughed out office the authority senator who has herself resigned you can nominate somebody competent for office don even bother kaylawhitmer absolutely disappointing that the democrats managed get two absolutely horrid speakers elected the span little over week the democrats couldn organize damn kid birthday party and they want third fourth and fifth chances prove they competent for the speakership had three goddamn speakers under month and this doesn concern democrats unfortunate that president kyo who loves pushing bipartisanship and talks about how they against partisan politics won even call the last two speakers out for their incompetence embarrassing terms and resignations you playing with the lives the american people and have decided play dumb partisan games knowing that this role democrats have consistently been incapable competently doing recently extremely embarrassing legoforol fortunate that you have not faced the kinds hardships brought sudden unexpected medical emergencies able hold this view hope that you forever stay good health and are never made through what hersey went through god

variety reasons but over time those factors have become less and less relevant the constitution was created with amendment process for reason which precisely how got the bill rights sought just focus what the founders wanted then the vast majority citizens would still disenfranchised the past few years have taken steps make our government more representative via reforming the electoral college the use ranked choice voting and allowing write candidates constitently all these reforms have the same goal that reforming the senate would have reducing the inequities that exist the current governance process that provide disproportionate say government matters based geography these plans may unique but say they are unprecedented would simply untrue have worked the past few years make the federal government more and more representative and this just another step that process jake what the angle this then because there are many forms senelectkearsley will voting against any constitutional amendment which transforms the senate into clone the house representatives the senate was created give small states say the federal government and must keep that purpose strongly support reforms strengthen voting rights but this not the way improve voter enfranchisement edited brikylake replying taylor current idea reapportionment senate seats some set interval based rolling averages those who voted each state but open other suggestions regarding how make the senate more proportional please contact office you want discuss details and talk out trade secretary taylor govcarolmarks let call this what this naked attempt advantage one state the detriment the others damned let lincoln voters disenfranchised this hare brained scheme brikylake replying carol marks current voting trends right now would lead increased senate seats both olympia and pacifica which fact two states not one furthermore these voting trends change the populations the states change while may advantage pacifica today would potentially help lincoln year from now these arguments are similar those defending the electoral college and yet have seen increased government activity and representation the years since reforming the electoral college this suggests that reform senate seat allocation would potentially have secondary benefits besides helping the federal legislative system adhere better the

confirmation that the office seaver would join this push but the 3rd party was apparently incorrect apologize the office senator seaver and hope that would keep open mind draft the constitutional

period the end the sentence edited threes head records sullivan said best during the election broadcast and try quote him directly possible nobody gives fuck about the rome statute they care about kitchen table issues what believe was exactly said even though disagree with him lot issues maybe some people should take his advice here threes genuinely one cares and also sev well know you don care don worry you don care about the american people and proper grammar know because the support you gave for the rome statute supporting something that would ruin the judicial system have created and sculpted for many years you did care and wish help americans then you would not have supported statute going directly against them threes didn care about the american people wouldn have proposed bill which would save americans money the grocery store stopping anticompetitive and inflationary mergers also wouldn have supported for speaker and majority leader that blocked budget leaving about days away from government shutdown and course barely anyone has mentioned this because they prefer fight partisan fights sev also not know where this idea that have reasoning for going against the rome statute have plenty reasoning just ask partisan fights did you and your left wing caucus members spend almost all the last session bickering the rome statute and using every power possible ram through

caucus after spending entire session doing nothing importance forcing the rome statute into law bending and outright ignoring the rules get done now that backfired you scrambling act like was never your priority the first place let honest this was what you wanted you and your left leaning allies pushed unconstitutional nonsense wasting time and resources partisan agenda and now now you want

has consistently been healthcare education and cost living spent the first month focusing the fix the public option act which overhauls four years failed and incoherent healthcare reforms into single new program and provides affordable healthcare coverage for everyone determined pass education and cost living reforms although that obviously subject how much the republican party willing cooperative

and have received copy this not good budget bill far very unhappy with the amount are spending certain areas which not need spend the senate conservatives will finding areas make large cuts fix this budget bill long the republican party has congressional majority and bears responsibility enact the goals the administration fighting relentlessly for the rome statute unsurprisingly made the defining image the administration thus far the administration comes the table and negotiates the senate conservatives are more than willing work with them don oppose passage budget but won passing one without heavy scrutiny sullivanjr and yet was your administration that put forth the senate for consideration your administration that supported and ultimately your administration that responsible for the mishandled ratification process the incompetence this office sadly astounding repkinsley your claims about healthcare and cost living reforms are just empty promises the fix the public option act bureaucratic mess will burden taxpayers and inevitably lead greater inefficiencies government the republicans have put forward long series bipartisan solutions address issues facing everyday americans but the president you sign them your attempt dismiss priorities such protecting life purely culture war just shows the people how frankly out touch you are your solution everything regulate regulate regulate how many bereaucrats does take fix lightbulb you want work towards progress president that means listening solutions that benefit the people and not washington insiders like yourself kyo notwithstanding the veracity these statements the claim itself pretty contradictory your initial claim that was the rome statute that was the priority and not healthcare reform kyo give the representative from frontier some latitude hard attack bill that you clearly haven read repkinsley two people walk into bar one common sense american and the other kyo supporter all sudden another man the bar starts choking the kyo supporter stands there and says well what throw couple billion into saving people from choking hazards maybe should hire some more bureaucrats regulate the common sense american realizes that meaningful action jump and save the man himself that all say simply throwing money the problem not always the solution sev kyo again pretty hard attack bill that you haven read

the public option act that the approach taken education reform and that the approach take the january budget sullivanjr that what repeated three times now maybe explain yourself more besides lol

war attrition against the american middle class she promised any individual with income higher than 125k which would include small business owners would audited and forced pay whatever amount the irs

speakers row who obstructed house business framing former president forcing everyone pay attention the rome statute which failed either way due sloppy writing all way pass through page bill that they didnt want anyone read enough enough the kyo administration will down one the worst history sullivanjr increasing irs funding after tax cheats common sense policy and shame that you don recognize that making sure every american including the ultra wealthy pay their fair share common sense bipartisan and efficent you want achieve balanced budget without raising taxes actually collecting the taxes already the books where you start olstrong brikylake tax experts have said again and again that when you increase enforcement with the income thresholds set president kyo that you end primarily increasing enforcement smaller businesses and middle class professionals the majority what call tax cheating legal tax avoidance rather than tax evasion the efforts the kyo administration boost enforcement will have the effect hitting middle class and upper middle class households proportionately more than upper class households due the realitively fixed costs audit compliance while focusing those efforts instead removing the loopholes utilized ultra high net worth individuals lower their tax paid legally would far more efficient method increasing revenues while not disproportionately benefiting the ultra wealthy sullivanjr didn hear you complaining when father did under republican administration brikylake didn exist was coma when your father was politically active edited axel the

one party consent laws jesus you really dont understand how the law works long appreciate the criticisms made rep dana fabe but confident that been designed best protect the interests all involved agree that automation can cruel sudden and impersonal process when one does meaningful work difficult feel that they may longer necessary for that particular task this may feel unfair but also unfair allow the american economy held hostage small special interest group under man worked longshoreman for years will receive the pay received his last year work for another years paid for the federal government and port management employees are more recent entrants the workforce they have much greater potential able retrain and aren prohibited from seeking work the federal government doesn train workers not any means convinced that bear obligation retrain them aren much putting longshoremen out work are breaking the labor cartel which the longshoremen unions hold over the ports and allowing the laws economics their work the only party harmed here are the unions which are corrupt mob tied and incentivized oppose real positive change development even against the interests their membership fabe isn about progress about prioritizing corporate interests the expense workers and communities yes automation inevitable but how manage the transition defines stripping union protections and criminalizing strikes isn positive change silencing the voices workers who built our ports and deserve seat the table the claim that unions are cartels ignores their critical role securing fair pay and safe working conditions for millions americans demonizing them undermines trust this process and risks alienating those need make work the severance plan may seem generous but ignores the long term economic displacement automation will cause without retraining programs displaced workers have little chance rebuild the federal government does bear responsibility ensure that one left behind the changes facilitates progress isn progress comes the cost dignity fairness and opportunity fails that test can better protectworkers fairtransition long frankly don understand how receiving years extremely high salaries with conditions attached and restrictions finding new employment attack workers the longshoremen unions have consistent opposed plans and technologies which would benefit our economy the ila opposed containerization which estimated have led 700 increase international trade displaced workers can rebuild finding new jobs every other american every other industry has without the assistance years compensation the real issue here that the longshoremen impose extortionate fees ports which have done real damage our economy when container arrives jacksonville miami the had economy like that the netherlands could taken smaller vessel along the coast new orleans instead america travels rail train creating more emissions per ton transported and putting more wear the roads that because unlike other countries the ila imposes touch charge for every container its members load unload that goes into the fund that pays for expenses like the 700 000 year salary the ila president receives which uses pay for his yacht you have plan for fair transition love see the meantime the republican party will confronting hard economic realities edited fabe easy paint unions villains but this misses the larger point doesn just target union leadership punishes the rank and file workers who rely collective power secure fair wages and protections demonizing all longshoremen for the actions few leaders unfair and counterproductive you call years partial pay generous but without retraining real job opportunities short term band aid for long term problem yes other industries face displacement but few are dismantled swiftly deliberately the port workforce under your point about emissions and logistics raises valid concerns but those issues are not solved breaking unions they solved innovation and collaboration containerization boosted trade 700 why not work with unions ensure automation delivers similar benefits without leaving workers behind for fair transition invest retraining programs that prepare workers for roles logistics technology clean energy include unions decision making ensuring they advocate for members best interests and yes regulate leadership needed but don dismantle the entire system isn confrontation with economic realities dismissal them real progress respects both growth and dignity long don think you have accurately considered what motivates union leadership union leadership benefited having many members possible getting much money from port management possible and keeping this the state affairs for long possible giving any these factors would involve making concessions the union and frankly doesn seem there are many more concessions make economic intervention the federal government has historically been most effective cases where the motivations economic actors brought them standstill where action was needed protect americans this case any move towards automation which available and desperately needed goes against the interests the leadership the ila even the members are receiving fair compensation how work with unions what want fundamentally undermines the interests their leadership pro union legislation wrote why farm workers can unionize this country and always supported them but right now america has some the least efficient ports the world and that large part because more people doing less work means more satisfied dues paying union members edited bored sullivan you doggg sullivanjr the right collectively bargin fundamental america oppose that oppose what are nation call unions

are two sections the bill that implement actual restrictions section and section section preserves the collective bargaining rights drivers against company interference and coercion section says that the federal government will not engage contracting with rideshare companies that fail consistent with providing minimum wage section pretty common sense section doesn actually impose any regulatory burdens because the companies can simply decide that underpaying their drivers more important than getting any federal contracts the legislation probably more moderate than what many people want but reflects the federal government ethical employer that doesn rely paying drivers below the minimum wage otherwise violating labor law retconned kyo while investigation the department defense has found

where talked her about the importance passing the volt act here the transcript secret that our current electrical system suboptimal best first and foremost there inherently uniformity typically states and localities will adopt parts the nec which popular independently ran electric code that updated every few years but these adoptions happen different times for example one county could have the latest edition the nec while one just across the river could still using electric code from the some states and localities struggle keep with new versions the fec which leaves them behind critical safety advancements which will continue cost capital and lives other bureaucratic factors have also delayed implementation local jurisdictions can also make their own modifications the nec which frankly disaster for electrical contractors they could have essentially learn different electric code for every jurisdiction they operate someone who has formerly worked electrical maintenance would know aside from these two big points can also get more depth with the current systems related economic inefficiencies safety concerns challenges for disaster recovery and barriers innovation brief sense the volt act ensures modern nationwide standard for electrical installations enhances residential electric safety reduces training cost for development contractors and streamlines training workers the volt act also increases our global competitiveness with international standards thank you madam president for hearing out the volt act currently sits with very capable hands the senate
